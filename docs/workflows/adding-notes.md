# Adding Notes & Documentation

⏱️ **Time:** 5 minutes to learn, ongoing to use

**What you'll accomplish:**

- Add notes to explain your rating decisions
- Document discussion points from calibration meetings
- Create an audit trail for future reference
- Export notes with your updated ratings

**Why This Matters:**

Notes help you remember why you made changes and provide context for future reviews. They're essential for calibration meetings, HR compliance, and explaining your decisions 6 months from now.

## When to Add Notes

### During Calibration Meetings

Notes are most valuable when you're making decisions with others:

- **Capture consensus decisions:** "Team agreed to move to High Potential based on Q4 project leadership"
- **Document stakeholder input:** "VP recommends development plan before promotion - needs presentation skills"
- **Record discussion points:** "Discussed with manager - performance dip attributed to team restructure"

### After Making Changes

Add notes immediately after moving someone to capture your reasoning:

- **Explain rating adjustments:** Why you moved this person
- **Note timing and context:** What triggered the change
- **Capture action items:** Next steps or follow-ups needed

### For High-Impact Decisions

Some changes deserve extra documentation:

- **Borderline promotions:** "High performer but potential needs validation - revisit in Q2"
- **Succession planning:** "Identified as backup for Director role - needs exposure to executive team"
- **Performance concerns:** "Performance declined after role change - providing mentoring in new skills"
- **Development needs:** "Ready for stretch assignment in Q1 - focus on stakeholder management"

## How to Add Notes

### Method 1: In the Changes Tab

This is the most common way to add notes after making changes.

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Move an employee** to a new position on the grid (drag and drop)

2. **Click the employee tile** to open the right panel

3. **Switch to the Changes tab** at the top of the panel

   ![Changes tab showing movement history with notes field highlighted](../images/screenshots/changes-add-note.png)

4. **Type your note** in the Notes field for that employee

5. **Click outside the field or press Tab** - your note saves automatically ✅

**What you'll see:**

- The employee's movement (from → to)
- A text field labeled "Add notes..."
- Your note appears immediately after typing

!!! tip "Notes save automatically"
    You don't need to click a Save button - notes are saved when you leave the text field.

### Method 2: For Multiple Employees

If you've moved several people, you can add notes to all of them from the Changes tab:

1. **Switch to the Changes tab** in the right panel (no employee selected)

2. **Review your change list** - all moves are shown in a table

3. **Click in the Notes field** for any employee

4. **Type your explanation** - it saves when you move to the next field

This lets you quickly document all your decisions in one place.

## Writing Effective Notes

### Good Note Examples

**Be specific and actionable:**

✅ "Moved from Medium to High performance based on Q3 project success - delivered $2M revenue initiative ahead of schedule"

✅ "Potential increased to High after succession planning discussion with VP - ready for Director role with 6 months mentoring"

✅ "Discussed with manager Jane Smith - employee needs coaching in presentation skills before promotion consideration"

✅ "Performance declined from High to Medium due to skill gap in new role - providing training in Python and SQL"

✅ "Calibration 2024-12: Adjusted to match peer ratings - initial rating was inflated relative to actual deliverables"

**What makes these good:**

- Specific reasons (not vague)
- Evidence or context (what changed)
- Professional tone (suitable for HR review)
- Actionable information (what happens next)
- Dates when relevant (Q3, 2024-12)

### Notes to Avoid

**Don't be vague:**

❌ "Changed rating" - Why? What changed?

❌ "Good performer" - Too generic, no specific information

❌ "8" - What does this mean? Performance? Potential?

**Don't be unprofessional:**

❌ "Not good enough for promotion" - Negative without being constructive

❌ "Manager is wrong about this person" - Confrontational tone

❌ "idk why but moved them" - Not helpful for future reference

**Don't skip context:**

❌ "Moved" - Where from? Where to? Why?

❌ "Discussed this" - With whom? What was decided?

❌ "See email" - The note should be self-contained

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific

Include what changed and why:

- **Weak:** "Performance improved"
- **Strong:** "Performance improved from Medium to High after completing leadership training and successfully managing team of 5"

### 2. Be Professional

Notes may be reviewed by HR, executives, or the employee themselves:

- Use objective language
- Focus on behaviors and outcomes, not personality
- Avoid emotional or judgmental terms
- Be constructive, even when noting concerns

### 3. Include Dates and Time Context

Help your future self understand when things happened:

- "As of Q4 2024..."
- "Performance review cycle ending Dec 2024..."
- "After 6 months in new role..."

### 4. Reference Evidence

Point to concrete information:

- "Based on 360 feedback showing strong peer ratings"
- "Delivered 3 major projects on time and under budget"
- "Manager reports consistent 1:1 performance discussions"
- "Metrics show 125% of quota achieved"

### 5. Note Action Items

Capture next steps or follow-ups:

- "Follow up with training plan in Q1"
- "Schedule check-in after 90 days in new role"
- "Revisit promotion readiness after next project delivery"
- "Manager to provide mentoring on stakeholder management"

Your notes are always available in the Changes tab:

1. **Open the Changes tab** in the right panel
2. **Review the change list** - notes appear next to each movement
3. **Edit notes anytime** - click in the field and type

Notes persist throughout your session until you upload new data.

### In Your Export

When you export to Excel, your notes are included:

1. **Open the File menu and click "Apply X Changes to Excel"** to download your modified file

2. **Open the Excel file** and look for the "9Boxer Change Notes" column

3. **Share with stakeholders** - notes are right there with the rating changes

![Exported Excel file showing the 9Boxer Change Notes column with example notes](../images/screenshots/export-excel-with-notes.png)

!!! info "Notes appear in exported file"
    The export includes:
    - **9Boxer Change Notes** column - Your notes for regular changes
    - **Donut Exercise Notes** column - Notes from donut mode validation (if applicable)

---

## Special Case: Donut Mode Notes

If you're using [Donut Mode](../donut-mode.md) to validate your center box, you can add notes there too:

1. **Activate Donut Mode**
2. **Move employees to their "true" positions**
3. **Add notes** explaining where you think they belong and why

These notes are tracked separately and appear in the "Donut Exercise Notes" column of your export.

**Example Donut Note:**

✅ "Actually High Potential - showed leadership in Q4 project. Should move out of center box."

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: HR Manager Documenting Calibration

**Situation:** You're running a talent calibration meeting with 5 managers.

**How to use notes:**

- Add notes during the meeting as decisions are made
- Capture which managers provided input
- Document consensus or dissenting views
- Note any follow-up actions required

**Example note:**
"Calibration 2024-12: Moved from Core to High Potential based on manager consensus. All 5 managers agreed on strong leadership demonstrated in cross-functional projects. Action: Schedule leadership development program enrollment."

### Scenario 2: Department Head Noting Development Plans

**Situation:** You're reviewing succession planning for key roles.

**How to use notes:**

- Identify high potentials ready for advancement
- Document development needs or gaps
- Note readiness timelines
- Capture mentoring or training requirements

**Example note:**
"Succession planning review: Identified as backup for Senior Director role. Needs 12 months development in strategic planning and executive communication. Pair with current director for mentoring."

### Scenario 3: Executive Recording Decisions

**Situation:** You're finalizing year-end ratings before board presentation.

**How to use notes:**

- Document rationale for top talent placements
- Note any concerns or risks
- Capture retention strategies
- Reference supporting evidence

**Example note:**
"Year-end 2024: Confirmed as Star - critical retention risk. Led 3 strategic initiatives generating $5M revenue. Recommend promotion to VP and equity refresh to retain through 2025."

## Tips for Efficient Note-Taking

### Use Templates

Create your own note templates for common situations:

**Promotion template:**
"Promoted to [role] in [quarter], demonstrating [key achievements]. Ready for [next opportunity]."

**Performance improvement template:**
"Performance improved from [old] to [new] due to [reason]. Next steps: [action items]."

**Calibration template:**
"Calibration [date]: Adjusted from [old] to [new] based on [reasoning]. Discussed with [stakeholders]."

### Keep Notes Concise

Aim for 1-3 sentences:

- One sentence: What changed
- One sentence: Why it changed
- One sentence: What happens next (optional)

### Update Notes as Situations Evolve

You can edit notes anytime during your session:

- Add new information as it emerges
- Clarify reasoning after discussions
- Update action items if plans change
