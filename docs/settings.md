### Theme Selection Indicator

The Settings dialog shows your current theme selection with:

- **Real-time preview** - The application theme changes immediately as you select different options

### Theme Persistence

Your theme preference is:

- **Persists across sessions** - reopening the app remembers your choice
- **Stored locally** in your browser's localStorage
- **Independent of other settings** - changing theme doesn't affect your data or filters

### System Theme Detection (Auto Mode)

When using **Auto (Follow System)** mode:

- 9Boxer detects your operating system's theme preference
- **Windows**: Follows Windows theme settings (Settings → Personalization → Colors)
- **macOS**: Follows macOS appearance (System Preferences → General → Appearance)
- **Linux**: Follows desktop environment theme settings
- **Dynamic updates**: Theme changes automatically when you change your OS theme (no app restart needed)

The Settings dialog shows which theme is currently active: "Currently using light theme (from system)" or "Currently using dark theme (from system)"
