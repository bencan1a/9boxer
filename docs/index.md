# Welcome to 9Boxer

**A simple, powerful desktop application for talent management**

## What is 9-Box?

The 9-box talent grid is a widely-used framework for evaluating and developing employees based on two key dimensions:

- **Performance** - Current performance in their role (Low, Medium, High)
- **Potential** - Future growth capacity and leadership capability (Low, Medium, High)

By plotting employees on a 3×3 grid, you can:

- **Identify top talent** and succession planning candidates
- **Spot under-performers** who need development or action plans
- **Visualize talent distribution** across your organization
- **Make informed decisions** about promotions, training, and retention

9Boxer brings this methodology to life with an intuitive desktop application that makes talent management fast, visual, and data-driven.
