## How to Use These Personas

When creating documentation, features, or workflows:

1. **Ask: Which persona needs this?** - Target specific user needs
2. **Use real names in examples** - "Sarah filters by department" not "A manager might filter"
3. **Match complexity to persona** - Alex needs basics, Priya needs advanced features
4. **Include specific numbers** - "47 employees" not "many employees"
5. **Show realistic scenarios** - Reference their actual workflows and pain points

These personas should inform:

- Documentation structure and tone
- Feature prioritization
- User interface design
- Tutorial and onboarding content
- Help documentation and tooltips
