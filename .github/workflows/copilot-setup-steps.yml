name: "Copilot Setup Steps"

# This workflow is used by GitHub Copilot's coding agent to set up the environment
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/customize-the-agent-environment
#
# NOTE: This workflow does NOT include actions/checkout@v4 because Copilot
# automatically clones the repository before running this setup. Including
# a checkout step causes "repository not found" errors due to permissions conflicts.
