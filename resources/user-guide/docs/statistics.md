# Statistics

The Statistics tab shows how your employees are distributed across the 9-box grid. Use it to understand your talent landscape and spot distribution issues.

## Accessing Statistics

1. Click any employee (or click in empty space)
2. Click the **Statistics** tab (third tab) in the right panel

## Distribution Table

The table shows employee counts and percentages for each grid position:

Each cell shows:
- **Count** - Number of employees in that box
- **Percentage** - Proportion of total workforce

---

## Distribution Chart

The bar chart provides a visual overview:

- Each bar represents one of the 9 grid boxes
- Bar height indicates employee count
- Makes imbalances obvious at a glance

## What to Look For

### Healthy Distribution (Rough Guidelines)

| Category | Target | Meaning |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Boxes 6, 8, 9 (High Performers) | ~20% | Your top performers and future leaders |
| Box 5 (Core Performers) | ~70% | Backbone of the organization |
| Boxes 1, 2, 4 (Lower) | ~10% | Improvement needed or new hires |

Positions 3 and 7 are typically smaller edge cases.

!!! note "Guidelines, Not Rules"
    Every organization is different. Use these as starting points, not strict targets.

### Warning Signs

- **Too many in top-right**: Possible grade inflation—are 50% of employees really Stars?
- **Too few in top row**: Succession planning risk, limited leadership pipeline
- **Heavy center clustering**: May indicate lack of differentiation ("safe" middle ratings)
- **Empty bottom boxes**: Could mean unrealistic expectations or hiring issues

---

## Grouping Options

Use the grouping dropdown to analyze distribution by different dimensions:

- **By Department** - Compare Engineering vs Sales vs Marketing
- **By Manager** - See individual manager rating patterns
- **By Location** - Compare offices or regions
- **By Job Level** - Compare ICs vs managers

This helps identify if certain groups have unusual distributions.

## Using Statistics with Filters

Apply filters first, then check Statistics to see that group's distribution in isolation:

1. Filter to a specific department (e.g., Engineering)
2. Open Statistics tab
3. See only that department's distribution

This reveals department-specific patterns the global view hides.

## Quick Reference

| I want to... | How to do it |
|--------------|-------------|
| See overall distribution | Click Statistics tab → View table and chart |
| Check percentage in each box | Look at table cells (shows count and %) |
| Spot imbalances | Look at bar chart for uneven heights |
| Compare departments | Use grouping dropdown → Select Department |
| See filtered distribution | Apply filters first → Then check Statistics |
