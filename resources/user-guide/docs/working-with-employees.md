## Moving Employees

> 📋 **Real-World Scenario**
>
> Alex is learning 9Boxer for the first time. She clicks and drags an employee from Core Talent to High Potential. The tile immediately gets an orange left border showing it's been modified, and the Apply button badge updates to show "1" change. She clicks the employee to view the timeline and confirms the change was recorded correctly.

### How to Drag and Drop

Moving employees is drag-and-drop simple:

1. **Click and hold** an employee tile
2. **Drag** to the box you want
3. **Release** to drop them in the new position
4. The tile gets an **orange left border** showing it's been modified
5. The "Apply" button badge shows your total change count

![Three-panel drag-and-drop sequence showing: panel 1 with employee tile highlighted and ready to drag, panel 2 showing the employee being dragged with motion indicator toward target box, and panel 3 showing the employee successfully placed in new position with visual confirmation of the move](images/screenshots/workflow/workflow-drag-drop-sequence-1.png)

![Employee tile with orange left border indicator showing that this employee has been moved or modified during the current session, distinguishing it from unmodified blue tiles](images/screenshots/workflow/workflow-employee-modified.png)

!!! tip "Visual Feedback"
    Modified employees display an orange left border, making it easy to see which employees have been moved during your session.

### Success! You've Moved an Employee

You'll see:
- Orange left border on the employee tile
- Employee now appears in their new grid box
- Apply button badge increases by 1
- Change recorded in timeline and Changes tab

### What Happens When You Move

When you drag an employee to a new box:

- Performance and potential ratings update automatically based on the new position
- The change gets recorded in the timeline (see Details tab)
- An orange left border appears on the tile
- The change counter updates to show total modifications

!!! warning "Remember"
    Changes aren't saved until you click "Apply" and export! Always export before closing the app.

## Selecting and Deselecting Employees

Here's how navigation works:

- **Click any employee** to view their details in the right panel
- **Click another employee** to switch who you're viewing
- **Click outside the grid** to deselect

## Adding Notes to Employees

Document why you moved someone:

1. **Click an employee** to open the right panel
2. **Go to the Changes tab**
3. **Click in the Notes field**
4. **Type your explanation** (e.g., "Promoted to manager role in Q4, strong leadership")
5. **Click outside or press ++tab++** to save
    - Notes save automatically
    - You can move to the next field right away

!!! tip "Note Best Practices"
    - Be specific (promotion, performance improvement, role change, etc.)
    - Keep it concise but informative
    - Use consistent terminology across your team
    - Notes support multiple lines for longer explanations

Notes help with:

- Calibration meetings and performance discussions
- Justifying rating changes to management
- Future reference when reviewing decisions
- Compliance and audit trails

See [Tracking Changes](tracking-changes.md) for more details.

## Viewing Employee Timeline

See the complete movement history for anyone:

1. **Click an employee** to open the right panel
2. **Go to the Details tab** (first tab)
3. **Scroll to the Timeline section**

![Timeline section showing employee movement history with timestamps, displaying previous positions and current position in chronological order with detailed box labels like "Core Performer [M,M]" to "Star [H,H]" showing performance and potential ratings for each historical entry](images/screenshots/timeline-employee-history.png)

You'll see:

- **Timestamps** - When each move happened
- **Position changes** - From position → To position
- **Box labels** - Clear labels (e.g., "Core Performer [M,M]" → "Star [H,H]")
- **Chronological order** - Most recent changes at the top

This helps you understand:

- Career progression patterns
- Rating trajectory over time
- When major movements happened
- Historical context for current placement

## Expanding and Collapsing Grid Boxes

Got a box with lots of employees? Expand it for better visibility.

### Multi-Column Layout

When you expand a box:

- **Click the expand button** (⛶ icon) on any box
- Employee cards arrange in **multiple columns** (instead of a single column)
- You'll see up to 3-4 columns depending on your screen size
- Drag-and-drop still works normally
- This beats excessive scrolling when you've got many employees in one box

### Collapsing Boxes

To collapse a box:

- **Click the collapse button** (⛶ icon) on the expanded box
- Or **press ++esc++** to collapse the current box

!!! info "Expansion State"
    Boxes stay expanded during your session, even if you switch views or select different employees.

## Understanding Employee Flags

Flags help you tag and track employees with special statuses or considerations. Think of them as color-coded sticky notes that travel with each employee.

### What Are Flags?

Flags are visual markers that highlight important employee attributes:

- **Career Development** - Promotion readiness, succession planning, lateral moves
- **Performance Management** - Performance improvement plans, flagged for discussion
- **Retention** - Flight risk, high retention priority
- **Onboarding** - New hire status
- **Strategic Moves** - Big Mover (employees who moved significantly in the grid)

!!! note "Why This Matters"
    During calibration meetings, flags help you quickly spot employees needing special attention. Instead of manually tracking who's at risk of leaving or ready for promotion, flags make this visible at a glance.

### All Flag Types

Here's every flag available in 9Boxer:

| Flag | Color | What It Means | When to Use |
|------|-------|---------------|-------------|
| **Promotion Ready** | Blue | Employee is ready for promotion to next level | You've validated they meet promotion criteria and have an open role |
| **Succession Candidate** | Purple | Identified for succession planning | Building succession plans for critical roles or leadership |
| **High Retention Priority** | Gold | Critical to retain, high business impact | Key talent you can't afford to lose |
| **Flight Risk** | Red | At risk of leaving the organization | Signs of disengagement, external interviews, or retention concerns |
| **Flagged for Discussion** | Orange | Needs team discussion or validation | Borderline placements, calibration disagreements, special cases |
| **New Hire** | Green | Recently joined organization | Still in onboarding or probation period |
| **Ready for Lateral Move** | Teal | Ready for role change at same level | Development opportunity through different function/team |
| **Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)** | Red | On formal performance improvement plan | Active PIP requiring monitoring and support |
| **Big Mover** | Cyan | Moved significantly during this session | Crossed from Low tier to High tier or vice versa (auto-flagged) |

### How Flags Are Determined

**Manually Set Flags (8 types):**

Most flags are set manually by you or your HR team:

- **Promotion Ready** - You decide based on performance reviews and readiness
- **Flight Risk** - Based on manager feedback, engagement surveys, or behavior changes
- **High Retention Priority** - Strategic decision based on business criticality
- **Succession Candidate** - HR/Leadership identifies for succession planning
- **Flagged for Discussion** - Anyone can flag when placement needs team consensus
- **New Hire** - Set during onboarding, typically for first 6-12 months
- **Ready for Lateral Move** - Manager/HR identifies development opportunities
- **PIP** - Set when formal performance improvement plan begins

**Auto-Flagged (1 type):**

- **Big Mover** - Automatically flagged when employee crosses performance tiers (Low to High or High to Low) during your session

!!! info "Flags in Your Excel File"
    Flags can be pre-loaded from your Excel upload file in the "Flags" column. Use comma-separated values like: `promotion_ready, flight_risk, high_retention_priority`

### Adding and Removing Flags

**How to Add a Flag:**

1. **Click an employee** to open the right panel
2. **Go to the Details tab**
3. **Scroll to the Flags section**
4. **Click the "Add Flag" dropdown**
5. **Select the flag** you want to add
6. The flag appears immediately as a colored chip

**How to Remove a Flag:**

1. **Click an employee** with flags
2. **Go to the Details tab**
3. **Find the flag chip** in the Flags section
4. **Click the X** on the flag chip
5. The flag is removed instantly

!!! tip "Bulk Flag Management"
    If you need to flag many employees at once, add the flags in your Excel file before uploading. The Flags column accepts comma-separated values for easy bulk tagging.

### Using Flags in Filtering

Flags become powerful when combined with filters:

**Single Flag Filter:**

- Open Filters drawer
- Check "Flight Risk" under Flags
- See only employees at risk of leaving

**Combine Multiple Flags:**

- Check "Flight Risk" + "High Retention Priority"
- See critical employees at risk (immediate action needed)

**Combine Flags + Other Filters:**

- Flags: "Promotion Ready"
- Job Function: "Engineering"
- Grid Position: "Position 8 or 9"
- Result: Promotion-ready engineers with high performance/potential

See [Filtering and Exclusions](filters.md#filtering-by-flags) for detailed filter instructions.

### Flag Combinations and What They Indicate

Certain flag combinations tell a story:

| Flag Combination | What It Indicates | Action Needed |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Flight Risk + High Retention Priority** | Critical employee at risk of leaving | Immediate retention conversation, stay interview, compensation review |
| **Promotion Ready + Succession Candidate** | Future leader ready to advance | Accelerate promotion timeline, assign stretch projects |
| **Flight Risk + Promotion Ready** | Frustrated high performer seeking growth | Urgent promotion discussion or risk losing them |
| **New Hire + PIP** | Recent hire struggling in role | Early intervention, additional training, or role fit assessment |
| **Big Mover + Flagged for Discussion** | Significant rating change needs validation | Team calibration to confirm or adjust placement |
| **High Retention Priority + PIP** | Critical employee with performance issues | Coaching and support to avoid losing valuable institutional knowledge |

### Big Mover Flag (Auto-Flagged)

The "Big Mover" flag is special - it's automatically applied when employees cross performance tiers:

**What Triggers Big Mover Flag:**

- Employee moved from **Low tier** (Boxes 1, 2, 3, 4) to **High tier** (Boxes 6, 8, 9)
- Employee moved from **High tier** (Boxes 6, 8, 9) to **Low tier** (Boxes 1, 2, 3, 4)

**Examples:**

- Box 1 (Low, Low) → Box 9 (High, High) = **Big Mover** ✓
- Box 2 (Medium, Low) → Box 8 (Medium, High) = **Big Mover** ✓
- Box 5 (Medium, Medium) → Box 6 (High, Medium) = Not a big mover ✗

**Why It Matters:**

Big movers indicate significant performance or potential shifts that deserve extra scrutiny:

- **Positive Big Movers:** Validate the improvement is real and sustainable
- **Negative Big Movers:** Understand what caused the decline and whether support is needed

The flag automatically appears/disappears as you drag employees, giving you instant feedback on significant movements.

### Flag Best Practices

**Be Specific:**

- Use "Promotion Ready" only when you've validated readiness (not just potential)
- Set "Flight Risk" based on evidence, not assumptions

**Keep Flags Updated:**

- Remove "New Hire" after 6-12 months
- Clear "PIP" when performance plan completes
- Update "Flight Risk" after retention conversations

**Combine Strategically:**

- "Flight Risk" + "High Retention Priority" = Immediate action list
- "Promotion Ready" + "Succession Candidate" = Leadership pipeline
- "Flagged for Discussion" + Grid Position filters = Calibration prep

**Export Includes Flags:**

- All flags export to Excel in the Flags column
- Use exported data for HR reporting and analytics
- Flag data persists across sessions when you re-upload

## Visual Indicators

Understanding the visual feedback system:

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Blue tile** | Default employee appearance (unchanged) |
| **Orange left border** | Employee has been moved (modified in session) |
| **Purple border + ghostly** | Employee in donut mode exercise (see [Donut Mode](donut-mode.md)) |
| **Colored flag chips** | Employee has special status flags (see [Understanding Employee Flags](#understanding-employee-flags)) |
| **Expand icon (⛶)** | Click to expand/collapse grid box |
