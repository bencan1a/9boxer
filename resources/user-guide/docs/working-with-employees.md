## When to Use This

### Common Scenarios

You'll want to work with individual employees when:

- **Reviewing performance details** - Check an employee's job level, manager, and organizational chain before making decisions
- **Making rating changes** - Drag employees to new boxes and verify the change with visual feedback ([see Making Your First Changes](workflows/making-changes.md))
- **Checking movement history** - View timeline to see when and why an employee's rating changed over time
- **During one-on-one reviews** - Pull up employee details to discuss performance and potential with their manager
- **Verifying placements** - Click employees to confirm they're in the correct box with accurate data

- [Adding Notes & Documentation](workflows/adding-notes.md) - Document rating decisions after viewing employee details
- [Preparing for Talent Calibration](workflows/talent-calibration.md) - Use employee details during calibration discussions

### Real-World Example

> 📋 **Scenario**
>
> During a calibration discussion, James clicks on employee "Maria Santos" to review her details. He sees she's been in her current role for 18 months (not new), reports to Sarah Lee, and was promoted from Medium to High Performance last quarter. This context helps the team validate her current High Performer rating.

- Employee name and ID
- Current performance and potential ratings
- Job level, profile, and manager
- Organizational chain hierarchy (Organization Name - Level 01, Level 02, etc.)
- **Timeline** - Complete history of all position changes with timestamps

The timeline helps you:

- Track when each employee was moved
- See their old and new positions
- Understand career progression over time

### Changes Tab

Track all employee movements across the 9-box grid:

- View all changes made to employees
- Add notes explaining why each change was made
- Notes are included when you export to Excel

See [Tracking Changes and Adding Notes](tracking-changes.md) for detailed information.

### Statistics Tab

See [Viewing Statistics and Intelligence](statistics.md) for comprehensive details.

### Intelligence Tab

Access advanced analytics and anomaly detection.

See [Intelligence Analysis](statistics.md#intelligence-tab) for detailed information.

## Moving Employees

> 📋 **Real-World Scenario**
>
> Alex is learning 9Boxer for the first time. She clicks and drags an employee from Core Talent to High Potential. The tile immediately gets an orange left border showing it's been modified, and the Apply button badge updates to show "1" change. She clicks the employee to view the timeline and confirms the change was recorded correctly.

### How to Drag and Drop

Moving employees between boxes is simple:

1. **Click and hold** on an employee tile
2. **Drag** to the desired box on the grid
3. **Release** to drop the employee in the new position
4. The tile gets an **orange left border** to indicate it's been modified
5. A badge on the "Apply" button shows your total change count

!!! tip "Visual Feedback"
    Modified employees display an orange left border, making it easy to see which employees have been moved during your session.

### What Happens When You Move

When you drag an employee to a new box:

- Employee's performance and potential ratings automatically update based on the new position
- The change is recorded in the timeline (visible in Details tab)
- An orange left border appears on the modified employee tile
- The change counter in the top bar increments to show total modifications

!!! warning "Remember"
    Changes are NOT saved until you click "Apply" and export! Always export your work before closing the application.

## Selecting and Deselecting Employees

Navigation and selection:

- **Click any employee tile** to select and view details in the right panel
- Selected employee details appear in the right panel
- **Click another employee** to change selection
- **Click outside the grid** or in an empty area to deselect

## Adding Notes to Employees

You can document the reasoning behind employee movements using the notes feature:

1. **Click an employee** to open the right panel
2. **Switch to the Changes tab**
3. **Click in the Notes field** for the employee
4. **Type your explanation** (e.g., "Promoted to manager role in Q4, strong leadership")
5. **Click outside the field or press ++tab++** to save
    - Notes save automatically in the background
    - You can immediately move to the next field without waiting

!!! tip "Note Best Practices"
    - Be specific about the reason (promotion, performance improvement, role change, etc.)
    - Keep notes concise but informative
    - Use consistent terminology across your team
    - Notes support multiple lines for longer explanations

Notes are valuable for:

- Calibration meetings and performance discussions
- Justifying rating changes to management
- Future reference when reviewing decisions
- Compliance and audit trails

See [Tracking Changes](tracking-changes.md) for more details on the change tracking system.

## Viewing Employee Timeline

The timeline feature shows the complete movement history for each employee:

1. **Click on an employee** to open the right panel
2. **View the Details tab** (first tab)
3. **Scroll to the Timeline section**

The timeline displays:

- **Timestamps** - When each movement occurred
- **Position changes** - From position → To position
- **Box labels** - Human-readable labels (e.g., "Core Performer [M,M]" → "Star [H,H]")
- **Chronological order** - Most recent changes at the top

This helps you understand:

- Career progression patterns
- Rating trajectory over time
- When major movements occurred
- Historical context for current placement

## Expanding and Collapsing Grid Boxes

When a grid box contains many employees, you can expand it for better visibility.

### Multi-Column Layout

When you expand a box containing multiple employees:

- **Click the expand button** (⛶ icon) on any box to expand it
- Employee cards automatically arrange in **multiple columns** (instead of a single column)
- Cards are displayed in a responsive grid that maximizes screen space
- Up to 3-4 columns may appear depending on your screen size
- All drag-and-drop functionality continues to work normally
- This makes it easier to see and manage boxes with many employees without excessive scrolling

<!-- Screenshot placeholder -->
!!! example "Screenshot Placeholder"
    **Expanded grid box showing multi-column employee layout**

    _(Screenshot to be added: Grid box expanded with employees in multiple columns)_

### Collapsing Boxes

To collapse an expanded box:

- **Click the collapse button** (⛶ icon) on the expanded box
- Or **press ++esc++** to collapse the currently expanded box

!!! info "Expansion State"
    The expansion state is remembered during your session, so boxes stay expanded even if you switch views or select different employees.

## Visual Indicators

Understanding the visual feedback system:

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Blue tile** | Default employee appearance (unchanged) |
| **Orange left border** | Employee has been moved (modified in session) |
| **Purple border + ghostly** | Employee in donut mode exercise (see [Donut Mode](donut-mode.md)) |
| **Expand icon (⛶)** | Click to expand/collapse grid box |
