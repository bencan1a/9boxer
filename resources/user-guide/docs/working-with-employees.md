## When to Use This

### Common Scenarios

You'll work with individual employees when you're:

- **Reviewing performance details** - Check job level, manager, and org chain before making decisions
- **Making rating changes** - Drag employees to new boxes and see instant visual feedback ([see Making Your First Changes](workflows/making-changes.md))
- **Checking movement history** - View the timeline to see when and why ratings changed
- **Running one-on-one reviews** - Pull up details to discuss performance and potential with managers
- **Verifying placements** - Confirm employees are in the right box with accurate data

- [Adding Notes & Documentation](workflows/adding-notes.md) - Document rating decisions after viewing employee details
- [Preparing for Talent Calibration](workflows/talent-calibration.md) - Use employee details during calibration discussions

### Real-World Example

> 📋 **Scenario**
>
> During a calibration discussion, James clicks on employee "Maria Santos" to review her details. He sees she's been in her current role for 18 months (not new), reports to Sarah Lee, and was promoted from Medium to High Performance last quarter. This context helps the team validate her current High Performer rating.

## Moving Employees

> 📋 **Real-World Scenario**
>
> Alex is learning 9Boxer for the first time. She clicks and drags an employee from Core Talent to High Potential. The tile immediately gets an orange left border showing it's been modified, and the Apply button badge updates to show "1" change. She clicks the employee to view the timeline and confirms the change was recorded correctly.

### How to Drag and Drop

Moving employees is drag-and-drop simple:

1. **Click and hold** an employee tile
2. **Drag** to the box you want
3. **Release** to drop them in the new position
4. The tile gets an **orange left border** showing it's been modified
5. The "Apply" button badge shows your total change count

![Three-panel drag-and-drop sequence showing: panel 1 with employee tile highlighted and ready to drag, panel 2 showing the employee being dragged with motion indicator toward target box, and panel 3 showing the employee successfully placed in new position with visual confirmation of the move](images/screenshots/workflow/workflow-drag-drop-sequence-1.png)

![Employee tile with orange left border indicator showing that this employee has been moved or modified during the current session, distinguishing it from unmodified blue tiles](images/screenshots/workflow/workflow-employee-modified.png)

!!! tip "Visual Feedback"
    Modified employees display an orange left border, making it easy to see which employees have been moved during your session.

### What Happens When You Move

When you drag an employee to a new box:

- Performance and potential ratings update automatically based on the new position
- The change gets recorded in the timeline (see Details tab)
- An orange left border appears on the tile
- The change counter updates to show total modifications

!!! warning "Remember"
    Changes aren't saved until you click "Apply" and export! Always export before closing the app.

## Selecting and Deselecting Employees

Here's how navigation works:

- **Click any employee** to view their details in the right panel
- **Click another employee** to switch who you're viewing
- **Click outside the grid** to deselect

## Adding Notes to Employees

Document why you moved someone:

1. **Click an employee** to open the right panel
2. **Go to the Changes tab**
3. **Click in the Notes field**
4. **Type your explanation** (e.g., "Promoted to manager role in Q4, strong leadership")
5. **Click outside or press ++tab++** to save
    - Notes save automatically
    - You can move to the next field right away

!!! tip "Note Best Practices"
    - Be specific (promotion, performance improvement, role change, etc.)
    - Keep it concise but informative
    - Use consistent terminology across your team
    - Notes support multiple lines for longer explanations

Notes help with:

- Calibration meetings and performance discussions
- Justifying rating changes to management
- Future reference when reviewing decisions
- Compliance and audit trails

See [Tracking Changes](tracking-changes.md) for more details.

## Viewing Employee Timeline

See the complete movement history for anyone:

1. **Click an employee** to open the right panel
2. **Go to the Details tab** (first tab)
3. **Scroll to the Timeline section**

![Timeline section showing employee movement history with timestamps, displaying previous positions and current position in chronological order with detailed box labels like "Core Performer [M,M]" to "Star [H,H]" showing performance and potential ratings for each historical entry](images/screenshots/timeline-employee-history.png)

You'll see:

- **Timestamps** - When each move happened
- **Position changes** - From position → To position
- **Box labels** - Clear labels (e.g., "Core Performer [M,M]" → "Star [H,H]")
- **Chronological order** - Most recent changes at the top

This helps you understand:

- Career progression patterns
- Rating trajectory over time
- When major movements happened
- Historical context for current placement

## Expanding and Collapsing Grid Boxes

Got a box with lots of employees? Expand it for better visibility.

### Multi-Column Layout

When you expand a box:

- **Click the expand button** (⛶ icon) on any box
- Employee cards arrange in **multiple columns** (instead of a single column)
- You'll see up to 3-4 columns depending on your screen size
- Drag-and-drop still works normally
- This beats excessive scrolling when you've got many employees in one box

### Collapsing Boxes

To collapse a box:

- **Click the collapse button** (⛶ icon) on the expanded box
- Or **press ++esc++** to collapse the current box

!!! info "Expansion State"
    Boxes stay expanded during your session, even if you switch views or select different employees.

## Visual Indicators

Understanding the visual feedback system:

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Blue tile** | Default employee appearance (unchanged) |
| **Orange left border** | Employee has been moved (modified in session) |
| **Purple border + ghostly** | Employee in donut mode exercise (see [Donut Mode](donut-mode.md)) |
| **Expand icon (⛶)** | Click to expand/collapse grid box |
