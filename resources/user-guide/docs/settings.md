### Theme Options

> 📋 **Real-World Scenario**
>
> Alex works from home and uses Auto mode to match her system theme. During the day, 9Boxer displays in light mode for comfortable viewing.

: Ideal for well-lit environments
: Icon: ☀️ Sun icon

**Dark Mode**

: Icon: 🔆 Brightness icon

### How to Change Theme

1. **Open Settings** by clicking the gear icon (⚙)
2. **Navigate to Appearance section** (selected by default)
3. **Select your preferred theme mode**:
    - Click the radio button next to your choice
    - The theme updates immediately
4. **Close the dialog** - your preference is saved automatically

### Theme Selection Indicator

The Settings dialog shows your current theme selection with:

- **Current Selection box** - Displays your chosen theme mode with icon
- **Active theme indicator** - When using "Auto" mode, shows which theme (light or dark) is currently active based on your system settings
- **Real-time preview** - The application theme changes immediately as you select different options

### Theme Persistence

Your theme choice:

- **Saves automatically** when you select it
- **Persists across sessions** - the app remembers your choice
- **Stored locally** in your browser's localStorage
- **Won't affect your data** - changing theme doesn't touch your filters or employee data

### System Theme Detection (Auto Mode)

When you use **Auto (Follow System)** mode:

- 9Boxer detects your OS theme preference
- **Windows**: Follows Windows theme settings (Settings → Personalization → Colors)
- **macOS**: Follows macOS appearance (System Preferences → General → Appearance)
- **Linux**: Follows desktop environment theme settings
- **Dynamic updates**: Theme changes automatically when your OS theme changes (no restart needed)

The Settings dialog shows which theme is active: "Currently using light theme (from system)" or "Currently using dark theme (from system)"

The Settings dialog gives you three theme choices. Your selection saves automatically and persists across sessions.
