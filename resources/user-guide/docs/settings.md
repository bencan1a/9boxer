    The application defaults to **Auto (Follow System)** mode, which automatically matches your operating system's theme preference.

### Theme Options

> 📋 **Real-World Scenario**
>
> Alex works from home and uses Auto mode to match her system theme. During the day, 9Boxer displays in light mode for comfortable viewing. When the sun sets at 6 PM, her MacOS automatically switches to dark mode, and 9Boxer instantly adjusts too, reducing eye strain during her evening calibration prep work.

**Light Mode**
: Always use the light theme
: Bright, high-contrast interface
: Ideal for well-lit environments
: Icon: ☀️ Sun icon

**Dark Mode**
: Always use the dark theme
: Reduced eye strain in low-light conditions
: Lower screen brightness
: Icon: 🌙 Moon icon

**Auto (Follow System)**

- **Independent of other settings** - changing theme doesn't affect your data or filters

### System Theme Detection (Auto Mode)

When using **Auto (Follow System)** mode:

- **Windows**: Follows Windows theme settings (Settings → Personalization → Colors)
- **macOS**: Follows macOS appearance (System Preferences → General → Appearance)
- **Linux**: Follows desktop environment theme settings
- **Dynamic updates**: Theme changes automatically when you change your OS theme (no app restart needed)

The Settings dialog shows which theme is currently active: "Currently using light theme (from system)" or "Currently using dark theme (from system)"
