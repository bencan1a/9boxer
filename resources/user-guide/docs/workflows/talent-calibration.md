## The Three Phases

Every calibration follows the same pattern:

1. **Pre-Meeting Preparation (20-30 min)** - Import data, validate distribution, identify discussion topics
2. **During Calibration Meeting (60-90 min)** - Review employees, reach consensus, make changes, document decisions
3. **Post-Meeting Follow-Up (10 min)** - Review final distribution, export results, communicate to stakeholders

---

## Pre-Meeting Checklist

Before your calibration session, complete these essential preparation steps to ensure a productive meeting:

- [ ] **Review Statistics tab** - Check distribution percentages, flag if >60% in center box
- [ ] **Check Intelligence tab** - Note red/yellow anomalies and patterns by manager/department
- [ ] **List borderline cases** - Employees who might move, Stars to validate, promotion candidates
- [ ] **Test your filters** - Practice showing one manager's team, High Performers, departments
- [ ] **Export pre-meeting baseline** - Name it `talent-ratings-pre-calibration-[YYYY-MM-DD].xlsx`
- [ ] **Share meeting agenda** - Send discussion topics to attendees

---

## Step 1: Import Your Data

1. Collect latest Performance/Potential ratings from all managers
2. Click **File** → **Import Data** and choose your Excel file
3. Verify employee count matches expectations in Statistics tab

---

## Step 2: Validate Your Distribution

### Review Statistics Tab

Click Statistics tab and check for red flags:

- ⚠️ >25% in top row = Grade inflation
- ⚠️ <5% Stars = Succession risk
- ⚠️ >70% in position 5 = Poor differentiation
- ⚠️ Empty boxes = Rating avoidance

![Statistics panel showing distribution table](../images/screenshots/statistics/statistics-panel-distribution.png)

### Review Intelligence Tab

Check Intelligence tab for anomalies by Location, Function, Level, and Tenure:

- Red = Critical (discuss immediately)
- Yellow = Moderate (worth reviewing)

![Intelligence summary showing quality score](../images/screenshots/workflow/intelligence-summary-anomalies.png)

Make notes on which anomalies to discuss in the meeting.

---

## Step 3: Identify Discussion Topics

### Use Filters to Find Borderline Cases

Click Filters and try these combinations:

- **High Performers** - Performance: High only
- **Borderline Stars** - Performance: High + Potential: Medium/High
- **Manager Comparison** - Select one manager to review their team

![Filters panel with calibration selections](../images/screenshots/workflow/calibration-filters-panel.png)

Click employees to review details and document questions for managers.

### Use Donut Mode to Validate Center Box

Donut Mode asks: "If center-box employees can't be Medium/Medium, where would they belong?"

1. Click View Mode toggle → Donut (shows only position 5 employees)
2. Drag each to their "true" position if they can't stay in center
3. Add notes explaining your reasoning
4. Review Donut Changes tab - these become discussion topics

![Donut mode active](../images/screenshots/donut/donut-mode-active-layout.png)

**What you'll learn:** If many move UP = inflated center ratings. If many move DOWN = over-rating average performers.

## Step 4: Prepare Meeting Materials

Create a prioritized discussion list:

- **High-priority:** Intelligence anomalies, borderline Stars, validate extremes
- **Medium-priority:** Donut findings, manager patterns, distribution imbalances

Formulate specific calibration questions for managers based on your analysis.

---

## Step 5: Export Pre-Meeting Baseline

1. Deactivate Donut Mode (toggle to Grid view)
2. Click File → Apply Changes to Excel
3. Rename file: `talent-ratings-pre-calibration-[YYYY-MM-DD].xlsx`
4. Share with attendees (optional)

## During-Meeting Checklist

Use this checklist during your live calibration session to stay organized and ensure all decisions are properly documented.

### Setup and Preparation

- [ ] Open 9Boxer with your data already loaded
- [ ] Share your screen in the video call
- [ ] Keep the right panel visible (Statistics, Intelligence, or Changes tabs)
- [ ] Have your discussion list ready (separate document or notes)

### For Each Employee Discussion

- [ ] Use filters to focus on the relevant group (manager, department, performance level)
- [ ] Show the employee details (click tile to open right panel)
- [ ] Facilitate discussion with prepared calibration questions
- [ ] Reach consensus or document disagreement professionally
- [ ] Make rating change in real-time if group agrees (drag employee to new box)
- [ ] Add note immediately explaining the calibration decision
- [ ] Include who was involved and why change was made

### Ongoing During Meeting

- [ ] Watch the File menu badge to track how many changes made
- [ ] Check Statistics tab periodically to see distribution shift
- [ ] Use filters liberally to focus discussion one cohort at a time
- [ ] Document action items for tabled discussions
- [ ] Keep discussions moving (2-3 minutes per employee max)
- [ ] Table contentious cases for offline follow-up rather than debating endlessly

### Before Ending Meeting

- [ ] Review Changes tab to ensure all moves have notes
- [ ] Verify Statistics tab shows improved distribution
- [ ] Check Intelligence tab to confirm major anomalies addressed
- [ ] Agree on next steps and communication plan
- [ ] Schedule follow-up meeting if needed

## After the Meeting

### Review and Export

2. Click **File** → **Apply X Changes to Excel**
3. Rename: `talent-ratings-post-calibration-[YYYY-MM-DD].xlsx`
4. Verify export shows updated ratings and notes

### Communicate Results

Send calibrated ratings to meeting attendees, HR team, individual managers, and leadership. Include summary of key changes and timeline for next calibration.

### Follow-Up Checklist

- [ ] Send results to attendees and managers within 24 hours
- [ ] Import to HRIS and archive files within 48 hours

## Tips from Experienced Users

!!! tip "Before the Meeting"
    **Do your homework** - Review Statistics and Intelligence before the meeting so you have specific questions ready.

    **Use Donut Mode privately** - Run the exercise yourself before the meeting to identify discussion topics.

    **Set expectations** - Tell attendees the meeting goals and how long you'll spend on each section.

!!! tip "During the Meeting"
    **Filter one manager at a time** - Review each manager's team as a group to spot their patterns.

    **Show the data visually** - Share your screen so everyone sees the same distribution.

    **Use zoom and full-screen for better visibility** - Press F11 for full-screen mode. Adjust zoom to 125-150% for better readability on projectors.

    **Document everything** - Add notes for every change made during the meeting.

    **Export frequently** - Save progress periodically during long meetings (use different filenames).

!!! tip "After the Meeting"
    **Compare before/after** - Open both pre- and post-calibration exports side-by-side to see total impact.

    **Follow up quickly** - Send results within 24 hours while the discussion is fresh.

    **Plan the next session** - Schedule the next calibration before everyone leaves.

## Common Calibration Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Grade Inflation

**Situation:** Statistics show 35% of employees rated "High Performance" (target is 20%).

**How to address:**

1. Filter to Performance: High
2. Review each High Performer as a group
3. Ask: "Who truly exceeds expectations vs. who just meets them?"
4. Recalibrate borderline cases to Medium
5. Document: "Calibrated - Performance is solid but not exceeding goals"

### Scenario 2: Manager Disagreement

**Situation:** Manager A insists Employee X is a Star, but Manager B (their previous manager) rated them as Core Talent.

**How to address:**

1. Click Employee X to show details
2. Review timeline showing the rating history
3. Ask both managers for specific evidence
4. Look at Intelligence data - how do they compare to peers?
5. Reach consensus or table for offline discussion
6. Document the final decision and reasoning

### Scenario 3: Overcrowded Center Box

**Situation:** 65 of 90 employees in position 5 (Core Talent).

**How to address:**

1. Activate Donut Mode
2. Work through each position 5 employee
3. Place them where they'd go if they can't stay in center
4. Review the Donut Changes tab
5. In the calibration meeting, discuss the Donut findings
6. Move employees to their actual ratings based on group consensus
