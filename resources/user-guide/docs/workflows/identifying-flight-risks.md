# Identifying Flight Risks

> **Time to complete:** 15-20 minutes
> **When to use this:** Quarterly retention reviews, before promotion cycles, or when attrition increases
> **You'll need:** Employee data with performance/potential ratings uploaded to 9Boxer

Identifying employees at risk of leaving before they hand in their resignation is critical for retention planning. This workflow shows you how to use 9Boxer to spot flight risks, analyze patterns, and take action before you lose your best people.

## When to Use This Workflow

Use this flight risk identification workflow when you need to:

- **Plan retention strategies** - Identify who to focus on for counter-offers, promotions, or development
- **Prepare for promotion cycles** - Ensure high performers aren't overlooked and looking elsewhere
- **Respond to market conditions** - When competitors are hiring or your industry is hot
- **Address attrition spikes** - Investigate patterns when turnover increases unexpectedly
- **Succession planning** - Ensure backup candidates exist for critical roles before people leave
- **Budget retention funds** - Prioritize who gets equity refreshes, bonuses, or salary adjustments

## Scenario: Marcus's Retention Crisis

Marcus is an HR Director at a 200-person tech company. In the past quarter, 3 high performers resigned with minimal warning - all went to competitors. The CEO is concerned about losing more top talent, especially with year-end bonuses approaching. Marcus needs to identify who else might be at risk and build a retention plan.

Let's follow Marcus's workflow.

## Step 1: Identify High-Value Flight Risks (5 minutes)

Start by finding employees who would hurt most if they left.

### Who Are Flight Risks?

Not everyone who leaves is a "flight risk" worth worrying about. Focus on:

**High-Value Employees:**

- Stars (Position 9 - High Performance, High Potential)
- High Performers (Positions 3, 6, 9 - anyone in the "High Performance" column)
- High Potentials (Positions 7, 8, 9 - anyone in the "High Potential" row)
- Critical specialists (unique skills, hard to replace)

**Warning Signs:**

- Recently passed over for promotion
- Performance trending down (may be disengaged)
- Tenure in sweet spot (2-5 years - proven value but not yet committed long-term)
- Underpaid relative to market (if you track compensation)
- Manager recently changed (relationship disruption)

### Filter to High Performers

1. Load your employee data (or use sample data to practice)
2. Click the **Filters** button in the toolbar
3. Under **Performance**, select **"High"** only
4. Leave other filters unchecked for now

You'll see only employees in the High Performance column (Positions 3, 6, 9).

![Filters panel with High Performance selected showing flight risk candidates](../images/screenshots/filters/filters-overview.png)

### Review the Grid

Look at the filtered view:

- **Stars (Position 9)** - Top-right corner - Highest risk if they leave
- **High Performers, Medium Potential (Position 6)** - Middle-right - May feel stuck
- **Strong Performers (Position 3)** - Bottom-right - May be mis-rated or undervalued

**Count them:** How many high performers do you have? Write it down.

### What Marcus Sees

Marcus filters to High Performance:

- 28 employees total (14% of workforce)
- 8 in Position 9 (Stars)
- 15 in Position 6 (High Performance, Medium Potential)
- 5 in Position 3 (High Performance, Low Potential)

**Marcus's Initial Observations:**

- 28 employees to evaluate for retention risk
- Stars are obvious priorities
- Position 6 employees might feel their potential is undervalued
- Position 3 employees may be mis-rated (high performance but "low potential"?)

### Success! You've Identified High-Value Employees

You'll see:
- Grid filtered to show only high performers
- Clear view of your most valuable talent
- Count of employees in each high-performance position
- Orange dot on Filters button (filters active)

!!! note "Why This Matters"
    Identifying flight risks before they resign gives you time to intervene. A targeted retention conversation or promotion can save your best people. Losing a Star employee costs 150-200% of their salary to replace.

---

## Step 2: Look for Behavioral Warning Signs (5 minutes)

Now layer on additional filters to find specific warning signs.

### Add Tenure Filter

Employees with 2-5 years tenure are often highest flight risk:

- Proven their value (marketable)
- Not yet committed long-term (less inertia)
- Know enough to be attractive to competitors
- May not feel invested enough to stay through challenges

**Apply the filter:**

1. Keep High Performance filter active
2. Scroll to **Tenure** section in Filters panel
3. Check **"2-3 years"** and **"3-5 years"**
4. Uncheck other tenure ranges

You'll now see only high performers with 2-5 years tenure.

### Check for Performance Trends

Look at the timeline for each employee:

1. Click an employee tile
2. Scroll to **Performance History** in the Details tab
3. Look for patterns:
   - **Declining performance** - May be disengaged or looking
   - **Flat trajectory** - No growth, may be bored
   - **Recent drop** - Something changed (manager, role, expectations)

**Red Flags:**

- Was Position 9 (Star) last year, now Position 6 (still high performance but potential dropped)
- Performance dropped from High to Medium recently
- No rating improvement despite strong work

### What Marcus Discovers

Marcus adds tenure filter (2-5 years):

- Now showing 12 high performers with 2-5 years tenure
- Clicks through each one to review timeline

**Flight Risk Profile Example - Sarah Chen:**

- Position 9 (Star) - Current
- Tenure: 3.5 years
- Timeline shows: Position 9 → Position 9 → Position 9 (consistently high)
- Notes: "Ready for promotion to Senior Engineer"
- **Warning:** Promotion ready but hasn't been promoted yet

**Flight Risk Profile Example - David Kumar:**

- Position 6 (High Performance, Medium Potential) - Current
- Tenure: 2.8 years
- Timeline shows: Position 9 (Star) → Position 6 (dropped potential rating)
- Notes: "Moved to new team Q3"
- **Warning:** Rating dropped after team change - may be struggling or disengaged

### ✅ Success! You've Spotted Warning Signs

You'll see:

- Filtered view showing high performers with risky tenure
- Timeline patterns revealing engagement or growth issues
- Specific employees flagged for retention conversation
- Notes providing context for rating changes

---

## Step 3: Use Intelligence to Spot Patterns (3 minutes)

Intelligence can reveal systemic issues causing flight risk.

### Check Intelligence Tab

1. Click the **Intelligence** tab in the right panel
2. Clear your filters temporarily (click **Clear All** in Filters panel)
3. Review the anomaly sections

Look for patterns that indicate retention problems:

**Manager Anomalies:**

- One manager has many fewer High Performers than peers → May be losing talent or harsh rater
- One manager's employees dropped from Star to Core → Team morale issue?

**Department Anomalies:**

- Engineering has fewer Stars than last quarter → Attrition already happening?
- Sales has high turnover in High Potential row → Promotion pipeline issue?

**Tenure Anomalies:**

- Employees with 3-5 years tenure rated lower than newer hires → Neglecting veterans?

### What Marcus Finds

Marcus reviews Intelligence:

- Yellow Anomaly: "Engineering Department - High Performers Below Baseline"
  - Expected: 12 High Performers in Engineering
  - Actual: 7 High Performers
  - **Insight:** Already lost high performers - need to protect remaining ones

- Red Anomaly: "Manager Lisa Park - Potential Ratings Below Baseline"
  - Expected: 40% High/Medium Potential in her team
  - Actual: 15% High/Medium Potential
  - **Insight:** Lisa may be under-rating potential or not developing her team

**Marcus's Takeaways:**

- Engineering has already lost talent (7 vs. expected 12 high performers)
- Lisa's team may have hidden flight risks (potential under-rated)
- Need to investigate both patterns urgently

### ✅ Success! You've Identified Systemic Issues

You'll see:

- Quality score indicating overall rating health
- Anomaly cards highlighting departments or managers with issues
- Statistical evidence of patterns (expected vs. actual counts)
- Insights into where flight risk is concentrated

---

## Step 4: Create Your Flight Risk List (4 minutes)

Now compile your findings into a prioritized action list.

### Segment Your Flight Risks

Based on your analysis, categorize employees:

**Critical - Act Immediately (Next 30 Days):**

- Stars ready for promotion but not promoted yet
- High performers with declining ratings or engagement
- Employees in understaffed teams (already losing people)
- Anyone with recent manager change + performance drop

**High Priority - Act This Quarter:**

- High performers with 2-5 years tenure (marketable)
- Position 6 employees who may feel potential is undervalued
- Teams with attrition patterns (protect remaining talent)
- Specialists with unique skills

**Monitor - Check-In Regularly:**

- High performers with 6+ years tenure (more invested)
- Recent promotions (recently rewarded)
- New hires in high-performance boxes (too early to leave)

### Create Action Plan

For each flight risk, determine the intervention:

**Retention Actions:**

- **Promotion** - If they're ready and role is available
- **Compensation adjustment** - Equity refresh, bonus, salary increase
- **Development plan** - Stretch assignments, mentoring, training
- **Career conversation** - Manager 1:1 to discuss growth path
- **Role change** - Lateral move to re-engage or fix team fit
- **Recognition** - Public acknowledgment, awards, visibility

### What Marcus Decides

Marcus creates his retention list:

**Critical - Act Immediately:**

1. **Sarah Chen** (Star, 3.5 years, promotion ready)
   - Action: Promote to Senior Engineer in Q1
   - Owner: Engineering Director
   - Deadline: January 15

2. **David Kumar** (Position 6, dropped from Star, 2.8 years)
   - Action: 1:1 with manager to understand rating drop + career discussion
   - Owner: Lisa Park (manager)
   - Deadline: This week

3. **Engineering High Performers** (7 remaining after attrition)
   - Action: Retention bonuses + career path conversations
   - Owner: Engineering Director
   - Deadline: Before year-end

**High Priority - Act This Quarter:**

4. **Lisa Park's Team** (potential under-rated)
   - Action: Calibration session with Lisa + development plan for her reports
   - Owner: Marcus (HR Director)
   - Deadline: End of Q1

5. **Position 6 Employees** (15 total - may feel stuck)
   - Action: Review each with managers - identify promotion candidates
   - Owner: Department heads
   - Deadline: End of Q1

### ✅ Success! You've Created Retention Plan

You'll have:

- Prioritized list of flight risk employees
- Specific actions for each person or group
- Owners assigned for each action
- Deadlines to ensure timely intervention

---

## Step 5: Document and Track (3 minutes)

Create notes for future reference and accountability.

### Add Notes to High-Risk Employees

For each critical flight risk:

1. Click the employee tile
2. Go to **Changes** tab (if you moved them) or create a separate tracking document
3. Add retention notes

**Example Notes:**

- "FLIGHT RISK: Promotion ready, not promoted. Engineering Director to act by Jan 15."
- "RETENTION ACTION: Career conversation with manager scheduled 12/20. Monitor engagement."
- "WATCH: Recent team change, rating dropped. Check-in in 30 days."

### Export for Stakeholder Review

Share your analysis with leadership:

1. Click **File** → **Apply Changes to Excel** (even if no rating changes)
2. Rename file: `flight-risk-analysis-2024-Q4.xlsx`
3. Share with executives, department heads, and managers

Include summary email:

**Subject:** Q4 Flight Risk Analysis - 12 Critical Retention Cases

**Body:**

"Attached is our flight risk analysis for Q4. Key findings:

- **28 high performers** identified across the organization
- **12 critical flight risks** requiring immediate action (next 30 days)
- **Engineering department** shows attrition pattern - 5 high performers lost this quarter
- **Action plan** included with owners and deadlines

Please review your team members flagged as flight risks and schedule retention conversations this week. Let me know if you need support with counter-offers, promotion approvals, or development plans."

### ✅ Success! You've Documented Your Analysis

You'll have:

- Notes attached to high-risk employees
- Exportable file with your analysis
- Summary for leadership communication
- Accountability and tracking for retention actions

## What Success Looks Like

You've successfully identified flight risks when you can answer:

- ✅ Who are your highest-value employees most likely to leave?
- ✅ What warning signs or patterns indicate flight risk?
- ✅ Which teams or managers have retention issues?
- ✅ What specific actions will you take to retain each person?
- ✅ Who owns each retention action and by when?
- ✅ How will you track and follow up on retention efforts?

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

!!! warning "Don't Wait for Resignation"
    By the time someone resigns, it's often too late. Proactive identification and intervention is key. Watch for early warning signs like declining performance or passed-over promotions.

!!! warning "Don't Focus Only on Stars"
    Position 6 and 3 employees (High Performance) are also valuable and at risk. Don't ignore them just because they're not "Stars."

!!! warning "Don't Ignore Patterns"
    If Intelligence flags a department or manager, investigate. Systemic issues cause multiple flight risks and won't fix themselves.

!!! warning "Don't Create Action Plan Without Follow-Through"
    A list without accountability is useless. Assign owners, set deadlines, and actually follow up on retention actions.

!!! warning "Don't Assume Tenure Equals Commitment"
    Employees with 10+ years can still leave if they feel undervalued or see better opportunities. Don't take anyone for granted.

## Real-World Example: How Sarah Saved Her Stars

Sarah, VP of People at a 150-person startup, used this workflow when she noticed 2 high performers resigned in one month.

**Her Process:**

1. **Filtered to High Performance** - Found 18 high performers
2. **Added tenure filter (2-5 years)** - Narrowed to 9 employees
3. **Reviewed timelines** - Found 3 ready for promotion but not promoted
4. **Checked Intelligence** - Discovered Product team losing talent (4 high performers left in 6 months)

**Her Actions:**

- Promoted 3 ready candidates immediately (retained all 3)
- Equity refresh for 4 Product team members (market adjustment)
- Career conversations with all 9 high-tenure/high-performance employees
- Calibration session with Product manager (addressing under-development)

**Results:**

- Zero high-performer resignations in following 6 months
- Employee engagement scores up 15% in Product team
- Succession pipeline strengthened (clear promotion path)

## Tips from Experienced Users

**Start with Intelligence, Then Filter**

> "I used to manually review everyone, but now I check Intelligence first to see which teams have issues. Then I filter to those teams and investigate specific people. Saves 30 minutes every time." - Rachel, HR Director

**Don't Forget Position 6 Employees**

> "We obsessed over Stars (Position 9) and missed that our Position 6 folks felt stuck. They're high performers who think we don't see their potential. Now we review Position 6 for promotion readiness every quarter." - James, Talent Lead

**Track Tenure Sweet Spot**

> "The 2-5 year tenure range is our danger zone. They're good enough for competitors to want them, but not invested enough to stay through challenges. We auto-flag anyone in this range for retention conversations." - Priya, VP Talent

**Use Timeline to Spot Disengagement**

> "When someone drops from Position 9 to Position 6, that's a red flag. Either they're struggling in a new role, or they're disengaged. Either way, their manager needs to act fast." - Marcus, HR Director

## Need Help?

**Common Questions:**

**Q: How often should I review flight risk?**

A: Quarterly at minimum. Best practice: before promotion cycles, after attrition spikes, and before major events (acquisitions, reorganizations). Track trends over time to measure retention effectiveness.

**Q: What if someone isn't a Star but is still critical?**

A: Specialists, deep experts, or employees with unique knowledge are flight risks even if not "High Performance/High Potential." Add notes flagging them as critical and include in your retention plan regardless of grid position.

**Q: Should I tell employees they're flagged as flight risk?**

A: No - that's awkward and may backfire. Instead, have authentic career conversations: "What are your goals? What would make you excited to stay? How can we support your growth?" Address their needs without labeling them "flight risk."

**Q: What if I can't promote or give raises due to budget?**

A: Retention isn't just about money. Try: stretch assignments, mentoring opportunities, visibility with executives, conference attendance, skill development, or lateral moves to re-engage. Career growth and recognition matter as much as compensation.
