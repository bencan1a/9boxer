- Verify your change was recorded

**Before you start:**
- Have your employee data uploaded
- Know which employee(s) you want to move
- Understand which box they should be in

## Why You'd Make Changes

Before we dive into the mechanics, let's talk about when and why you'd move someone.

### Common Scenarios

You'll typically change ratings in these situations:

**Recent promotion or role change**
: Someone moved into a leadership role and is demonstrating higher potential than before.

**Performance improvement**
: An employee who was struggling has shown significant improvement over the past quarter.

**Performance decline**
: Someone's output has dropped, possibly due to skill gaps or personal circumstances.

**Calibration adjustment**
: After discussing with other managers, you realize a rating is too high or too low compared to peers.

**Initial error correction**
: You uploaded data and notice someone is in the wrong box - maybe a typo in the original file.

**New information received**
: You just completed performance reviews and have updated assessments to reflect.

## Moving an Employee (The Core Workflow)

Let's walk through making your first change. Don't worry - it's simple, and you can always move them back if you make a mistake!

### Step 1: Find the Employee

First, locate the employee you want to move.

**Option A: Visual scanning**
- Look across the grid for their name
- They're organized by performance (left to right) and potential (bottom to top)

**Option B: Use search** (if you have many employees)
- Click the **Filters** button in the top toolbar
- Use the search field to find them by name
- [Learn more about filtering](../filters.md)

**Option C: Click through the box**
- If a box has many employees, click the expand icon (⛶) on the box header
- Scroll through the list to find them
- Press `Esc` to collapse when done

### Step 2: Drag to the New Box

Once you've found your employee, moving them is drag-and-drop:

1. **Click and hold** on the employee tile
   - You'll see a drag handle icon (≡) on the left side of the tile
   - The tile becomes slightly transparent while dragging

2. **Drag** the tile to the target box
   - Move your mouse to the box where they should be
   - The cursor changes to show you're dragging

3. **Release** (drop) the tile
   - Let go of the mouse button
   - The employee appears in their new box immediately

![Three-panel sequence showing: 1) clicking on an employee tile, 2) dragging it across the grid, 3) dropping it in the new position](../images/screenshots/workflow/making-changes-drag-sequence-base.png)

!!! tip "Can't drag?"
    Make sure you're clicking directly on the employee tile or the drag handle area.
    If filters are active, ensure the employee is visible (not filtered out).

### Step 3: Look for the Orange Border

After you drop the employee, watch for the **visual feedback** that confirms your change:

- The employee tile gets a **thick orange border on the left side**
- A small **"Modified" badge** appears on the tile
- This border stays visible for the entire session

![Employee tile showing the orange left border and "Modified" badge indicating it has been changed](../images/screenshots/making-changes-orange-border.png)

**What this means:**
- ✅ Your change was successful
- ✅ This employee has been modified in the current session
- ✅ The change will be included when you export

!!! info "Orange, not yellow?"
    You might hear this called a "yellow highlight" or "orange border" - same thing!
    The color adapts to light/dark mode, but it's always the "secondary" accent color.

## Verifying Your Change

Want to double-check that your move was recorded? Here are three ways to verify:

### Check the Employee Details

1. **Click on the employee tile** you just moved
2. The right panel opens showing their details
3. Look at the **Performance and Potential** values - they should reflect the new box

![Employee details panel showing updated Performance and Potential ratings](../images/screenshots/workflow/making-changes-employee-details.png)

### View the Timeline

Still in the employee details panel:

1. Scroll down to the **Performance History** section
2. You'll see "2025 (Current)" with their new ratings
3. Compare to previous years to see the change

![Timeline view showing the employee's current position and historical ratings](../images/screenshots/workflow/making-changes-timeline.png)

### Check the Changes Tab

For a complete record of all your changes:

1. Click the **Changes** tab in the right panel (fourth tab)
2. You'll see a table listing all movements in this session
3. Find your employee in the list
4. The "Movement" column shows: `Old Position → New Position`

![Changes tab showing a table of all employee movements with old and new positions](../images/screenshots/workflow/making-changes-changes-tab.png)

!!! success "Pro tip: Add notes here!"
    While you're in the Changes tab, type a quick note in the "Notes" field explaining why you moved this person.
    Your future self (and your colleagues) will thank you!

## Making Multiple Changes

Got several people to move? Here's how to work efficiently:

### Strategy 1: Move One at a Time

The simplest approach for a few changes:

1. Move first employee
2. Verify the orange border appears
3. Move next employee
4. Repeat

**Advantage:** You can confirm each change as you go.

### Strategy 2: Use Filters to Focus

For many changes in a specific group:

1. Click **Filters** and select a department or manager
2. The grid shows only that group
3. Make all your changes to that group
4. Clear filters to see the full grid again
5. [Learn about filtering strategies](../filters.md)

**Advantage:** Reduces visual clutter and helps you focus.

### Strategy 3: Review Changes Tab Periodically

During a long session with many moves:

1. Make 5-10 changes
2. Open the **Changes** tab
3. Review the list to ensure all moves are correct
4. Continue with the next batch

**Advantage:** Catch mistakes early before making too many changes.

!!! warning "Remember: No auto-save!"
    Your changes are stored in your browser while you work, but they're NOT saved to a file automatically.
    Click **Export** when you're done to download your updated ratings.
    [Learn about exporting](../exporting.md)

## Understanding What Happens When You Move Someone

Let's clarify what changes (and what doesn't) when you move an employee:

### What Changes ✅

- **Grid position:** They appear in the new box
- **Performance/Potential ratings:** Updated to match the new box
- **Visual indicator:** Orange border appears on the tile
- **Changes tab:** New entry added with old → new position
- **Export:** When you export, the Excel file will have updated ratings

### What Doesn't Change ❌

- **Original data:** Your original Excel file is NOT modified
- **Employee name, title, job level:** These stay the same
- **Historical ratings:** Past performance data is preserved
- **Other employees:** Only the employee you moved is affected

### The Change is Reversible

Made a mistake? No problem!

**To undo a move:**
1. Drag the employee back to their original position
2. The orange border remains (they're still "modified in session")
3. The new position will reflect the original ratings
4. The Changes tab shows the full history (both moves)

**To cancel all changes:**
- Reload the page (without exporting)
- Upload a fresh copy of your data file
- Your original data remains unchanged

!!! danger "Closing without exporting loses all changes!"
    If you close 9Boxer without clicking Export, ALL your changes are lost.
    There's no "Save" button - exporting IS saving!

## Real-World Scenarios

Let's look at some common situations and how you'd handle them:

### Scenario 1: Promoting a High Performer

**Situation:** Sarah was a Strong Performer (position 3: High Performance, Low Potential), but she just got promoted to team lead and is showing leadership capabilities.

**Action:**
1. Find Sarah's tile in the bottom-right box
2. Drag to position 6 (High Performance, Medium Potential) or position 9 (High Performance, High Potential)
3. In the Changes tab, add note: "Promoted to Team Lead Q1 2025, demonstrating leadership skills"

**Why this matters:** You're recognizing her growth trajectory, which impacts succession planning.

---

### Scenario 2: Calibration Adjustment

**Situation:** During calibration, you realize you rated Tom as High Performance (position 6), but compared to peers across teams, he's really Medium Performance (position 5).

**Action:**
1. Find Tom in position 6 (Core Performer - High/Medium)
2. Drag to position 5 (Core Performer - Medium/Medium)
3. Add note: "Calibration 2025-01: Adjusted to Medium based on peer comparison with other teams"

**Why this matters:** Ensures fairness and consistency across the organization.

---

### Scenario 3: Performance Decline

**Situation:** Maria was in position 9 (Star) last year, but her performance has noticeably declined in her new role.

**Action:**
1. Find Maria in position 9 (top-right corner)
2. Drag to position 8 (High Potential, Medium Performance) - she still has potential but performance dropped
3. Add note: "Performance declined in new role - skill gap identified. Development plan in progress."

**Why this matters:** Honest assessment while acknowledging she may recover with support.

## Common Questions

### What if I move someone by accident?

Just drag them back! The Changes tab will show both moves, but when you export, only the final position matters.

### Can I move multiple people at once?

No, you need to move them one at a time. This is intentional - each move should be deliberate.

### Will my changes affect other people's views?

No. Changes are stored only in your browser session. When you export, you create a new file that you can share.

### How many changes can I make in one session?

You can make unlimited changes in one session. The Changes tab tracks them all.

### What if I close the app before exporting?

All changes are lost. The app will warn you if you try to upload new data while you have unsaved changes.

### Can I see who moved an employee in the past?

The app shows you the movement history (timeline), but doesn't track who made each change. Add notes to create that audit trail.
