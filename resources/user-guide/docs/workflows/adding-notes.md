# Adding Notes & Documentation

⏱️ **Time:** 5 minutes to learn, ongoing to use

**What you'll accomplish:**

- Add notes to explain your rating decisions
- Document discussion points from calibration meetings
- Create an audit trail for future reference
- Export notes with your updated ratings

**Why This Matters:**

Notes help you remember why you made changes and provide context for future reviews. They're essential for calibration meetings, HR compliance, and explaining your decisions 6 months from now.

## Note Quality Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure your notes are clear, compliant, and useful for future reference.

### Before Writing a Note

- [ ] Understand what changed (old position → new position)
- [ ] Know why it changed (specific reason or trigger)
- [ ] Have evidence or context to support the change
- [ ] Confirm who was involved in the decision

### While Writing a Note

- [ ] Include specific dates or timeframes (when the change occurred)
- [ ] Cite concrete evidence (metrics, projects, behaviors, feedback)
- [ ] Name people involved (managers, calibration team, stakeholders)
- [ ] Use professional, objective language (facts, not opinions)
- [ ] Keep it concise (1-3 sentences typically sufficient)
- [ ] Make it self-contained (don't reference external documents)

### Legal and Compliance Review

- [ ] Avoid references to protected classes (age, race, gender, religion, disability)
- [ ] Avoid speculative or assumptive language (stick to facts)
- [ ] Avoid inflammatory or judgmental language (no personal attacks)
- [ ] Avoid medical or personal information (health, family situations)
- [ ] Avoid retaliation language (no references to complaints or protected activities)
- [ ] When in doubt about sensitive situations, consult HR or legal

### After Writing a Note

- [ ] Read note aloud - does it sound professional and clear?
- [ ] Verify note provides enough context for someone unfamiliar with situation
- [ ] Confirm note is defendable and based on performance, not personality
- [ ] Check that note includes action items or next steps if applicable
- [ ] Ensure note will make sense 6 months from now

### Before Exporting

- [ ] Review all notes in Changes tab for completeness
- [ ] Verify every change has a note (no blank note fields)
- [ ] Check that notes are consistent in tone and format
- [ ] Confirm sensitive situations were documented appropriately
- [ ] Ensure notes provide full audit trail for compliance

## When to Add Notes

### During Calibration Meetings

Notes are most valuable when you're making decisions with others:

- **Capture consensus decisions:** "Team agreed to move to High Potential based on Q4 project leadership"
- **Document stakeholder input:** "VP recommends development plan before promotion - needs presentation skills"
- **Record discussion points:** "Discussed with manager - performance dip attributed to team restructure"

### After Making Changes

Add notes immediately after moving someone to capture your reasoning:

- **Explain rating adjustments:** Why you moved this person
- **Note timing and context:** What triggered the change
- **Capture action items:** Next steps or follow-ups needed

### For High-Impact Decisions

Some changes deserve extra documentation:

- **Borderline promotions:** "High performer but potential needs validation - revisit in Q2"
- **Succession planning:** "Identified as backup for Director role - needs exposure to executive team"
- **Performance concerns:** "Performance declined after role change - providing mentoring in new skills"
- **Development needs:** "Ready for stretch assignment in Q1 - focus on stakeholder management"

---

## How to Add Notes

### Method 1: In the Changes Tab

This is the most common way to add notes after making changes.

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Move an employee** to a new position on the grid (drag and drop)

2. **Click the employee tile** to open the right panel

3. **Switch to the Changes tab** at the top of the panel

   ![Changes tab showing movement history with notes field highlighted](../images/screenshots/workflow/workflow-changes-add-note.png)

4. **Type your note** in the Notes field for that employee

5. **Click outside the field or press Tab** - your note saves automatically ✅

**What you'll see:**

- The employee's movement (from → to)
- A text field labeled "Add notes..."
- Your note appears immediately after typing

!!! tip "Notes save automatically"
    You don't need to click a Save button - notes are saved when you leave the text field.

### Success! You've Added a Note

You'll see:
- Note appears in the Notes field immediately
- Note saves automatically when you tab away
- Note included in Excel export
- Audit trail created for the rating change

!!! note "Why This Matters"
    Notes create accountability and memory. When someone questions a rating change six months later, your note explains exactly what happened and why. This protects you and maintains fairness across reviews.

### Method 2: For Multiple Employees

If you've moved several people, you can add notes to all of them from the Changes tab:

1. **Switch to the Changes tab** in the right panel (no employee selected)

2. **Review your change list** - all moves are shown in a table

3. **Click in the Notes field** for any employee

4. **Type your explanation** - it saves when you move to the next field

This lets you quickly document all your decisions in one place.

## Writing Effective Notes

### Good Note Examples vs. Bad Note Examples

Learn what makes a note helpful by comparing good and bad examples:

#### Example 1: Promotion

❌ **BAD:** "Promoted"

✅ **GOOD:** "Promoted to Senior Engineer on Dec 1, 2024. Demonstrated leadership by mentoring 3 junior engineers and leading Q4 infrastructure project. Potential increased to High - ready for management track."

**Why the good example works:** Includes date, specific role, evidence of why promotion happened, and future implications.

---

#### Example 2: Calibration Adjustment

❌ **BAD:** "Changed after meeting"

✅ **GOOD:** "Calibration 2024-Q4: Moved from Star (Position 9) to High Performer (Position 6) based on peer comparison. Performance remains high, but potential rating was inflated relative to company standards. Discussed with manager Alex Chen - agreed on recalibration."

**Why the good example works:** Explains what meeting, what changed and why, includes manager name for accountability, shows consensus.

---

#### Example 3: Performance Decline

❌ **BAD:** "Not performing well"

✅ **GOOD:** "Performance declined from High to Medium over Q3-Q4 2024. New role requires Python/ML skills not yet developed. Providing training and pairing with senior data scientist. Revisit rating in Q1 2025 after skills development."

**Why the good example works:** Specific timeframe, explains reason for decline, includes support plan, sets follow-up expectation.

---

#### Example 4: Disputed Rating

❌ **BAD:** "Manager disagrees"

✅ **GOOD:** "Calibration 2024-Q4: Manager Lisa Park advocates for Star rating based on technical contributions. Calibration team consensus: High Performer (Position 6) more appropriate given peer comparison. Lisa's dissenting view documented. Will revisit in Q1 after next project delivery."

**Why the good example works:** Acknowledges disagreement professionally, explains both perspectives, documents resolution, includes follow-up.

---

#### Example 5: Retention Risk

❌ **BAD:** "Might leave"

✅ **GOOD:** "Flight risk identified - ready for promotion but not yet promoted (tenure: 3.5 years, consistently Star rated). Engineering Director to discuss promotion to Senior Engineer by Jan 15. Monitor engagement closely."

**Why the good example works:** Explains why they're flight risk, includes specific action with owner and deadline, notes monitoring need.

---

#### Example 6: New Information

❌ **BAD:** "Updated rating"

✅ **GOOD:** "Updated from Medium to High Performance based on 2024 annual review completed Dec 10. Exceeded all goals - 125% quota, led 2 major client wins, peer feedback consistently excellent. Manager Sarah Jones recommends for High Potential consideration in Q1."

**Why the good example works:** Cites specific review, includes quantitative evidence, shows peer/manager input, suggests next steps.

### What Makes Notes Good vs. Bad

| Good Notes Include | Bad Notes Have |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Specific dates or timeframes | Vague timing ("recently", "a while ago") |
| Concrete evidence (metrics, projects, behaviors) | Generic statements ("doing well") |
| Names of people involved (managers, stakeholders) | No attribution ("discussed") |
| Action items or next steps | No follow-up plan |
| Professional, objective language | Emotional or judgmental tone |
| Self-contained context | References to external docs ("see email") |
| Clear what changed and why | Just the outcome, no reasoning |

## Note Templates for Common Scenarios

Copy and customize these templates for your most frequent note-taking needs:

### Template 1: Promotion or Role Change

```
Promoted to [ROLE] on [DATE]. Demonstrating [KEY NEW CAPABILITY/ACHIEVEMENT].

## Legal and Compliance Considerations

Your notes may be reviewed in legal contexts. Follow these guidelines to protect your organization:

### What to Include for Legal Safety

✅ **Objective, factual language**
- Focus on observable behaviors and measurable results
- "Delivered 5 projects on time" not "Is a hard worker"
- "Missed 3 deadlines in Q3" not "Doesn't care about work"

✅ **Evidence-based reasoning**
- Cite specific performance data, feedback, or metrics
- Reference calibration consensus or manager discussions
- Link to performance reviews or formal assessments

✅ **Dates and timelines**
- When rating changed
- When discussions occurred
- When reviews were completed
- When follow-up is planned

✅ **Attribution and accountability**
- Who made the decision (manager, calibration team, HR)
- Who was consulted
- Whose input was considered

### What to Avoid for Legal Protection

❌ **Protected class references**
- Never mention age, race, gender, religion, disability, etc.
- Even if relevant to context, keep separate from performance notes
- Example: ❌ "As a new parent, performance has declined"
- Instead: ✅ "Performance declined Q3-Q4 2024, discussed support options"

❌ **Speculative or assumptive language**
- Don't guess at motivations or personal circumstances
- ❌ "Probably looking for another job"
- ✅ "Engagement declined based on 1:1 feedback, retention conversation scheduled"

❌ **Inflammatory or judgmental language**
- No personal attacks or character judgments
- ❌ "Lazy and doesn't care"
- ✅ "Missed 4 deadlines in Q4, performance improvement plan initiated"

❌ **Medical or personal information**
- Don't reference health conditions, family situations, etc.
- ❌ "Performance declined due to health issues"
- ✅ "Performance declined Q3-Q4, employee on approved leave, rating revisit upon return"

❌ **Retaliation language**
- No references to complaints, whistleblowing, or protected activities
- ❌ "Rating lowered after HR complaint"
- ✅ "Rating adjusted during calibration to align with peer standards"

### Compliance Best Practices

**1. Consistency**
- Use similar note templates for similar situations
- Apply same standards across all employees
- Document all rating changes, not just some

**2. Reviewability**
- Assume your notes will be read by HR, legal, or in litigation
- Would this note make sense to someone unfamiliar with the situation?
- Is it defensible and based on performance, not personality?

**3. Retention**
- Notes become part of employment record
- May be retained for years per company policy
- Could be subpoenaed in legal proceedings

**4. Consultation**
- When in doubt about sensitive situations, consult HR or legal
- For disputed ratings, document all perspectives
- For performance issues, align with formal performance management process

### Red Flag Situations - Consult HR/Legal

Seek guidance before documenting these situations:

⚠️ **Employee on leave** (medical, family, etc.)
⚠️ **Recent complaint or protected activity** (discrimination, whistleblower, etc.)
⚠️ **Performance decline concurrent with protected activity**
⚠️ **Disputed rating with legal implications** (promotion denial, compensation impact)
⚠️ **Termination or performance improvement plan imminent**
⚠️ **Disability accommodation requests**

**In these cases:**
1. Pause before adding notes
2. Consult your HR business partner or legal team
3. Use company-approved language for sensitive situations
4. Ensure notes align with formal documentation (PIPs, accommodations, etc.)

### Sample Compliant Notes for Sensitive Situations

**Performance issue (legally safe):**
✅ "Performance rating lowered from High to Medium based on Q3-Q4 results. Missed 5 project deadlines, quality metrics below standards. Formal performance improvement plan initiated Nov 1, 2024. Will reassess in 90 days per company policy."

**Leave of absence (legally safe):**
✅ "Rating unchanged from previous period. Employee on approved leave Q3-Q4 2024. Performance assessment deferred until return to work. Revisit rating in Q1 2025 after 90 days back."

**Accommodation request (legally safe):**
✅ "Performance rating maintained. Employee requested accommodation Nov 2024, currently under review with HR. Performance assessment will continue per standard review cycle. Next review: Q1 2025."

"Performance improved from [old] to [new] due to [reason]. Next steps: [action items]."

**Calibration template:**
"Calibration [date]: Adjusted from [old] to [new] based on [reasoning]. Discussed with [stakeholders]."

### Keep Notes Concise

Aim for 1-3 sentences:

- One sentence: What changed
- One sentence: Why it changed
- One sentence: What happens next (optional)

### Update Notes as Situations Evolve

You can edit notes anytime during your session:

- Add new information as it emerges
- Clarify reasoning after discussions
- Update action items if plans change
