## What is the 9-Box Grid?

The 9-box talent grid helps you evaluate employees based on two key dimensions:

- **Performance** - How well they're doing in their current role
- **Potential** - Their capacity for growth and future leadership

By plotting everyone on a 3x3 grid, you can quickly identify your top talent, spot development needs, and make informed decisions about promotions and succession planning.
