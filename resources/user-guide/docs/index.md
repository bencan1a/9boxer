# Welcome to 9Boxer

**Visualize your team's talent, drive better calibration conversations, make confident decisions.**

9Boxer is a desktop application that helps you manage talent using the 9-box performance/potential grid. Import your HR data, visualize distribution patterns, spot rating bias, and run efficient calibration meetings - all while keeping sensitive employee data secure on your computer.

## Why 9Boxer?

9Boxer was born out of frustration with running performance calibration sessions in Excel.

The author spent years facilitating talent reviews across departments, levels, and locations - and struggled to visualize performance patterns effectively. Discussions often went in circles. Rating bias went undetected. Without easy visualization and analysis tools, calibration was a chore that didn't deliver the insights needed to keep the organization healthy.

So 9Boxer was built to solve these problems:

- **Use the data you already have** - Import directly from your HR export. No new systems to maintain.
- **Keep data local** - Employee performance data is sensitive. It never leaves your machine.
- **Drive better meetings** - Visual tools that focus discussions and surface patterns you'd miss in spreadsheets.
- **Spot bias automatically** - Statistical analysis detects rating inflation, manager leniency, and distribution problems.

> **A note on development:** 9Boxer is entirely developed by AI coding agents with one human directing them. It's an experiment in agent-driven development - exploring how far this approach can go and what it teaches us about building software in a new way.

## What is the 9-Box Grid?

The 9-box talent grid evaluates employees on two dimensions:

- **Performance** - How well they're doing in their current role
- **Potential** - Their capacity for growth and future leadership

By plotting everyone on a 3x3 grid, you can quickly identify top talent, spot development needs, and make informed decisions about promotions and succession planning.
