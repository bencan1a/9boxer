## What Is the 9-Box Grid?

Think of the 9-box grid as a simple 3×3 tic-tac-toe board that helps you visualize your team's talent.

### The Two Dimensions

The grid plots each employee based on two key factors:

**Performance (X-axis, left to right):**
- How well they're doing **right now** in their current role
- Ratings: Low, Medium, High

**Potential (Y-axis, bottom to top):**
- Their capacity for **future growth** and advancement
- Ratings: Low, Medium, High

![Annotated grid showing Performance axis (horizontal) and Potential axis (vertical)](images/screenshots/workflow/workflow-grid-axes-labeled.png)

### Why Two Dimensions Matter

Here's the key insight: **performance and potential are different things.**

- A high performer might be excellent in their current role but have limited capacity for advancement (best as a senior individual contributor)
- A high-potential employee might be new or still developing but shows clear leadership capacity (future manager material)
- Your best employees combine both: high performance today AND high potential for tomorrow

This is why we need a grid instead of a single rating - it captures both dimensions at once.

---

## Why Organizations Use the 9-Box

The 9-box methodology helps you answer critical talent questions:

### Strategic Questions

**Succession Planning:**
- Who can step into leadership roles if someone leaves?
- Do we have enough future leaders in our pipeline?

**Development Planning:**
- Who needs intensive development to reach their potential?
- Where should we invest our limited development resources?

**Retention Strategy:**
- Who are our highest-value employees we must retain?
- Which employees are critical to protect from competitors?

**Performance Management:**
- Who needs performance improvement plans?
- Who's struggling and needs support or transition?

### Calibration Across Teams

The 9-box grid creates a common language for talent discussions:

- Ensures managers use consistent rating standards
- Makes talent visible across organizational boundaries
- Prevents grade inflation ("everyone is High Performance")
- Identifies rating bias (one manager rates everyone high, another rates everyone low)

!!! note "Why This Matters"
    Without the 9-box framework, talent discussions become subjective debates. The grid provides structure, making it easier to compare employees fairly and make data-driven decisions about promotions, development, and resource allocation.

## Understanding the 9 Positions

Each box in the grid has strategic meaning. Here's what you need to know about each position:

### Visual Grid Layout

```
                 LOW               MEDIUM            HIGH
              PERFORMANCE        PERFORMANCE      PERFORMANCE

HIGH          Enigma/              High            ⭐ Stars

              Position 1          Position 2       Position 3
```

### The Most Important Positions to Understand

Let's start with the positions you'll focus on most:

#### Position 9: Stars (High Performance, High Potential)

**Top-right corner - Your future leaders**

**Who belongs here:**
- Consistently exceed expectations in their current role
- Show clear capacity for advancement and leadership
- Ready for bigger challenges and responsibilities

**What to do with them:**
- **Retention priority:** Keep them engaged and challenged
- **Succession planning:** Identify for key leadership roles
- **Development:** Provide stretch assignments and growth opportunities
- **Compensation:** Ensure competitive pay and recognition

**Target population:** 10-15% of your workforce

**Red flag:** If you have 50% Stars, you're over-rating. Be more selective.

---

#### Position 5: Core Performers (Medium Performance, Medium Potential)

**Center box - The backbone of your organization**

**Who belongs here:**
- Meet expectations consistently and reliably
- Solid contributors who keep things running smoothly
- Steady, dependable employees

**What to do with them:**
- **Recognition:** Acknowledge their steady contributions
- **Development:** Offer growth opportunities to move toward Position 6 or 8
- **Validation:** Use Donut Mode to ensure they truly belong here (not hidden high performers)

**Target population:** 50-60% of your workforce

**Warning:** The center box often becomes a default placement for "I'm not sure where they belong." Use [Donut Mode](donut-mode.md) to validate these ratings.

---

#### Position 1: Too New / Problem (Low Performance, Low Potential)

**Bottom-left corner - Requires attention**

**Who belongs here:**
- **New hires:** Too early to rate accurately (give them time)
- **Performance issues:** Not meeting expectations with limited growth capacity

**What to do with them:**
- **For new employees:** Provide onboarding support, reassess in 6-12 months
- **For existing employees:** Performance improvement plan, coaching, or exit discussion

**Target population:** 5-10% of your workforce

**Critical:** Don't confuse "too new to rate" with "performance problem." They're different situations requiring different actions.

---

### The Other Six Positions (Quick Reference)

**Position 8: High Potential (Medium Performance, High Potential)**
- Future leaders still developing - invest in their growth
- May be new to role or need more experience
- Fast-track development opportunities

**Position 7: Enigma (Low Performance, High Potential)**
- High potential but currently underperforming - investigate why
- Could be wrong role fit, lack of support, or too new
- Decide if they can improve or need a change

**Position 6: High Performer (High Performance, Medium Potential)**
- Excellent in current role but limited advancement interest
- Critical individual contributors and subject matter experts
- Retain and reward - don't assume they need promotion

**Position 4: Under-Performer (Low Performance, Medium Potential)**
- Has potential but not currently delivering
- Performance improvement plan with clear goals
- Monitor progress, provide support

**Position 3: Strong Performer (High Performance, Low Potential)**
- Excel in current role with limited advancement desire
- Valuable individual contributors - respect their choice
- Leverage as mentors and technical specialists

**Position 2: Solid Performer (Medium Performance, Low Potential)**
- Reliable workers meeting minimum standards
- Provide stability and clear expectations
- Ensure they don't decline toward Position 1

## Common Calibration Scenarios

As you prepare for calibration meetings, here are typical situations you'll encounter:

### Scenario 1: The "Everyone Is High Performance" Trap

**Situation:** You rated 80% of your team as High Performance because you genuinely believe they're all doing great work.

**The problem:** Statistical reality says not everyone can be above average. This indicates grade inflation.

**What to do:**
1. Compare your team to organizational benchmarks (typically 15-20% High Performance)
2. Ask: "If I could only promote 3 people tomorrow, who would they be?" - Those are your true high performers
3. Recalibrate using relative rankings within your team
4. Use the Statistics tab to see your distribution and identify skew

**Outcome:** A more realistic distribution where High Performance truly means exceptional.

---

### Scenario 2: The "I Don't Know Their Potential" Dilemma

**Situation:** You can rate current performance easily but struggle to assess future potential.

**The problem:** Potential is harder to evaluate than performance, especially for new managers.

**What to do:**
1. **Ask these questions:**
   - Can they handle more complex responsibilities?
   - Do they show leadership behaviors (mentoring others, taking initiative)?
   - How far could they advance if given the right opportunities?
2. **Look for evidence:**
   - Do they seek feedback and learn from it?
   - Can they adapt to new situations?
   - Do they influence others positively?
3. **When uncertain, default to Medium Potential** and revisit next quarter

**Outcome:** More confident potential ratings based on observable behaviors.

---

### Scenario 3: The "Everyone Clustered in the Center" Pattern

**Situation:** You placed 70% of your team in the center box (Core Performers) because you're not comfortable differentiating.

**The problem:** This avoids difficult decisions and hides both stars and under-performers.

**What to do:**
1. **Run Donut Mode exercise** to force differentiation ([see complete guide](donut-mode.md))
2. **Ask for each center box employee:** "If they couldn't be Medium/Medium, where would they actually belong?"
3. **Look for hidden patterns:**
   - Are some truly high performers you're under-rating?
   - Are some actually struggling but you avoided placing them low?
4. **Use peer comparison:** Compare similar employees to identify real differences

**Outcome:** Better differentiation revealing your actual stars and employees needing support.

---

### Scenario 4: The "New Hire Rating" Question

**Situation:** You have 5 employees hired in the past 3 months. Where do they belong?

**The problem:** Rating new hires too early leads to inflated ratings based on potential rather than proven performance.

**What to do:**
1. **Place new hires in Position 1 (Too New)** or default to Medium/Medium with a note
2. **Add note:** "New hire - provisional rating pending 6-month performance data"
3. **Set review milestone:** Flag for reassessment after onboarding period
4. **Focus on trajectory:** Are they ramping quickly? Showing early promise?
5. **Wait for performance data** before assigning High Potential

**Outcome:** More accurate ratings that avoid new hire inflation.

---

### Scenario 5: The "Performance vs. Potential Confusion"

**Situation:** Your best performer is also rated High Potential, but they've told you they don't want to be a manager.

**The problem:** Confusing "high performance" with "high potential for leadership."

**What to do:**
1. **Clarify what Potential means:**
   - Potential = capacity for growth and advancement (not just management)
   - High performers can have low potential if they're best in their current role
2. **Have the conversation:** Do they want to advance, or do they prefer to deepen expertise?
3. **Consider Position 6 or 3:** High Performance + Medium or Low Potential
4. **Respect their choice:** Not everyone needs or wants to be promoted

**Outcome:** More accurate placement that respects individual career preferences.

## Getting Started Guide for New Users

Follow these steps to complete your first 9-box assessment with confidence:

### Step 1: Understand Your Team's Context (30 minutes)

Before rating anyone, gather context:

**Review your team roster:**
- Who reports to you (direct and indirect)?
- What roles do they perform?
- How long have they been in their current positions?

**Clarify organizational expectations:**
- What percentage should be rated High Performance? (typically 15-20%)
- Are there specific calibration criteria to use?
- When is the calibration meeting scheduled?

**Prepare performance data:**
- Recent project outcomes
- Goal achievement metrics
- Peer and customer feedback
- Development progress

---

### Step 2: Rate Performance First (1 hour)

Start with Performance because it's easier to assess than Potential.

**For each employee, ask:**
- How well do they execute in their current role?
- Do they meet, exceed, or fall short of expectations?
- What results have they delivered in the past 6-12 months?

**Rating guidance:**
- **Low:** Below expectations, needs improvement
- **Medium:** Meets expectations consistently
- **High:** Exceeds expectations, outstanding results

**Tips:**
- Use relative ranking: Compare team members to each other
- Be specific: Base ratings on evidence, not gut feel
- Avoid clustering: Differentiate between similar performers

---

### Step 3: Rate Potential Second (1 hour)

Now assess future capacity (this is harder but important).

**For each employee, ask:**
- How far could they advance in the organization?
- Do they have capacity for bigger roles or leadership?
- Can they learn new skills and adapt to change?

**Rating guidance:**
- **Low:** Best suited to current role, limited advancement capacity
- **Medium:** Could advance 1-2 levels with development
- **High:** Leadership potential, could advance 3+ levels

**Look for evidence:**
- Do they seek feedback and act on it?
- Do they influence and mentor others?
- Can they handle ambiguity and complexity?
- Do they demonstrate strategic thinking?

**When uncertain:** Default to Medium and revisit next quarter with more data.

---

### Step 4: Plot on the Grid in 9Boxer (30 minutes)

Now transfer your ratings to 9Boxer:

1. **Prepare your Excel file** with required columns: Employee ID, Worker, Performance, Potential
2. **Upload to 9Boxer** via File > Import Data
3. **Review the grid** to see how your team is distributed
4. **Check Statistics tab** to see distribution percentages

**What to look for:**
- Does the distribution look realistic?
- Are there too many in one box?
- Does it match your intuition about your team?

---

### Step 5: Validate with Donut Mode (30 minutes, optional but recommended)

If your center box is crowded (>60% of employees), run the Donut Mode exercise:

1. **Activate Donut Mode** (see [complete guide](donut-mode.md))
2. **For each center box employee, ask:** "If they can't be Medium/Medium, where do they belong?"
3. **Place on the donut** at their true level
4. **Compare results** to your original grid
5. **Recalibrate** employees who were mis-placed

This exercise reveals hidden high performers and employees who need more support.

---

### Step 6: Add Notes and Document Decisions (30 minutes)

For every employee you rated (especially those you moved):

1. **Click the employee tile** to open details
2. **Go to Changes tab**
3. **Add a note** explaining your rating

**Good note examples:**
- "High Performer: Led 3 major projects this quarter, all delivered ahead of schedule"
- "High Potential: Shows strong leadership in team meetings, mentors junior engineers"
- "New hire - too early to rate accurately, reassess in 6 months"
- "Solid performer but best in current role, not interested in management"

Notes help you remember your reasoning and defend ratings in calibration.

---

### Step 7: Review Distribution and Export (15 minutes)

Before calibration, validate your work:

1. **Check Statistics tab:**
   - Is distribution realistic? (10-15% Stars, 50-60% middle tier)
   - Any red flags? (too many high, too few stars)
2. **Check Intelligence tab:**
   - Any anomalies or bias patterns detected?
3. **Review Changes tab:**
   - Do all changes have notes?
4. **Export to Excel:**
   - File > Apply Changes to Excel
   - Save as: `talent_[yourname]_YYYY-MM-DD.xlsx`

**Total time:** 3-4 hours for a first-time 9-box assessment of 25 employees.

## Key Principles for New Users

As you get started, keep these core principles in mind:

### 1. Performance and Potential Are Different

Don't rate them the same. High performers aren't automatically high potential, and vice versa.

**Ask distinct questions:**
- Performance: "How well do they do their current job?"
- Potential: "How far could they advance?"

---

### 2. Differentiation Is Essential

Not everyone can be High Performance or in the center box.

**Healthy distribution:**
- 10-15% Stars (Position 9)
- 50-60% in middle tier (Positions 2, 4, 5, 6)
- Some in top row (High Potential pipeline)
- Some in lower boxes (performance concerns or new hires)

---

### 3. Use Evidence, Not Gut Feel

Base ratings on observable performance and behaviors, not personal feelings.

**Good evidence:**
- Project outcomes and deliverables
- Goal achievement metrics
- 360-degree feedback
- Demonstrated leadership behaviors
- Client or peer testimonials

**Poor evidence:**
- "They seem promising"
- "I just have a feeling"
- "Everyone likes them"

---

### 4. Calibration Is Where the Magic Happens

Your initial ratings are a starting point, not the final answer.

**Calibration helps:**
- Ensure consistent standards across managers
- Validate ratings through peer discussion
- Identify and correct bias
- Build consensus on borderline cases

Come to calibration prepared to discuss and adjust.

---

### 5. The Grid Is a Planning Tool

The 9-box isn't just a rating exercise - it drives action.

**Different boxes require different strategies:**
- **Stars:** Retention and succession planning
- **High Potential:** Development acceleration
- **Under-Performers:** Performance improvement or transition
- **Core Performers:** Engagement and skill development

Use the grid to guide resource allocation and development decisions.

---

## Common Mistakes New Users Make

Avoid these pitfalls as you get started:

### Mistake 1: Rating Everyone Medium/Medium

**Why it happens:** Fear of difficult conversations, uncertainty about criteria.

**The problem:** Avoids differentiation, hides both stars and under-performers.

**Solution:** Use Donut Mode to force ranking. Ask "If they can't all be Medium, who's actually higher or lower?"

---

### Mistake 2: Conflating Performance with Potential

**Why it happens:** Intuitive assumption that top performers are also high potential.

**The problem:** Misses excellent individual contributors (High Performance, Low Potential) and future leaders still developing (Low Performance, High Potential).

**Solution:** Rate each dimension separately using distinct questions. See [Understanding the Grid](understanding-grid.md#axis-definitions).

---

### Mistake 3: Rating New Hires Too Quickly

**Why it happens:** Optimism from successful hiring, pressure to complete all ratings.

**The problem:** Inflates potential ratings based on interviews, not actual performance.

**Solution:** Mark new hires as "Too New to Rate" in Position 1 or default to Medium/Medium with a note. Reassess after 6-12 months.

---

### Mistake 4: Not Adding Notes

**Why it happens:** Time pressure, assuming you'll remember later.

**The problem:** Can't defend ratings in calibration, lose reasoning over time.

**Solution:** Add brief notes as you rate. 1-2 sentences per employee is enough.

---

### Mistake 5: Not Exporting for Stakeholders

**Why it happens:** Forgetting that others need the updated data.

**The problem:** Calibration decisions not shared with HR, managers, or leadership.

**Solution:** Export at milestones - after calibration meetings, before quarterly reviews, when sharing with stakeholders.

---

## Next Steps After Your First Rating

Once you've completed your initial 9-box assessment:

### Prepare for Calibration

1. **Review your distribution** using Statistics tab
2. **Identify employees you're uncertain about** and prepare discussion points
3. **Check Intelligence tab** for anomalies that might come up
4. **Print or screenshot your grid** for reference during the meeting
5. **Bring your notes** to defend rating decisions
