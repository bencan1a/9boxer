## When to Use This

### Common Scenarios

You'll use keyboard shortcuts when you're:

- **Working fast during calibration meetings** - Zoom, navigate, and toggle views without breaking flow
- **Presenting on a large screen** - Use full-screen mode and zoom controls for better visibility
- **Reviewing lots of employees** - Tab through fields and collapse boxes quickly
- **Navigating with precision** - Keyboard shortcuts are often faster and more accurate than mouse clicks

## Navigation Shortcuts

### Grid Navigation

**Escape Key - Collapse Expanded Box**

When you've expanded a grid box to see more employees:

- Press **++esc++** to collapse the box instantly
- Works from anywhere in the app
- Faster than clicking the collapse button

> 💡 **Why This Matters**
>
> During busy calibration sessions, you'll expand boxes frequently to review groups. The Escape key lets you collapse and move on without hunting for the collapse button.

### Employee Details Navigation

**Tab Key - Move Between Fields**

When adding notes or editing employee details:

- Press **++tab++** to save the current field and move to the next one
- Auto-saves your changes as you go
- Keeps your hands on the keyboard

> 💡 **Why This Matters**
>
> When documenting decisions for multiple employees, Tab keeps you moving fast. No need to click outside the field or grab your mouse.

## View Control Shortcuts

### Zoom Controls

**Zoom In**

- **Windows:** ++ctrl+plus++ or ++ctrl+=++
- **macOS:** ++cmd+plus++ or ++cmd+=++
- **Alternative:** ++ctrl+scroll++ up (Windows) or ++cmd+scroll++ up (macOS)

Makes the grid larger for better visibility or when presenting on big screens.

**Zoom Out**

- **Windows:** ++ctrl+minus++
- **macOS:** ++cmd+minus++
- **Alternative:** ++ctrl+scroll++ down (Windows) or ++cmd+scroll++ down (macOS)

Shrinks the grid to see more boxes at once.

**Reset Zoom**

- **Windows:** ++ctrl+0++
- **macOS:** ++cmd+0++

Returns to default 100% zoom level.

!!! tip "Mouse Wheel Zoom"
    Hold Ctrl (Windows) or Cmd (macOS) and scroll your mouse wheel to zoom in and out smoothly. This works anywhere on the grid.

### Full-Screen Mode

**Toggle Full-Screen**

- **All Platforms:** ++f11++

Enters or exits full-screen mode for maximum grid visibility.

!!! info "Full-Screen Behavior"
    Full-screen hides your browser chrome (address bar, tabs, bookmarks). Press F11 again or click the Exit Full-Screen button to return to normal view.

### Donut Mode Toggle

**Toggle Donut Mode On/Off**

- **All Platforms:** ++d++ (lowercase)

Switches between Grid View and Donut Mode.

!!! warning "Session Required"
    The D key shortcut only works when you have an active session (file loaded). It won't work on the empty state screen.

!!! info "Input Fields"
    The D key won't trigger donut mode when you're typing in a text field or notes area. This prevents accidental mode switches while documenting.

## Platform Differences

### Windows vs macOS Modifier Keys

The main difference between platforms is the modifier key:

| Action | Windows | macOS |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Zoom In | ++ctrl+plus++ | ++cmd+plus++ |
| Zoom Out | ++ctrl+minus++ | ++cmd+minus++ |
| Reset Zoom | ++ctrl+0++ | ++cmd+0++ |
| Scroll Zoom | ++ctrl+scroll++ | ++cmd+scroll++ |

**Rule of Thumb:**

- **Windows/Linux:** Use ++ctrl++ (Control key)
- **macOS:** Use ++cmd++ (Command key)

### Function Keys

Function key behavior is identical across platforms:

- **++f11++** - Full-screen (works the same everywhere)
- **++esc++** - Collapse box (works the same everywhere)
- **++d++** - Toggle donut mode (works the same everywhere)

## Quick Actions

### Filter Operations

Currently, filter operations use mouse/click interactions only. There are no dedicated keyboard shortcuts for:

- Opening the filter drawer
- Selecting filter criteria
- Applying or clearing filters

**Workaround:** Use ++tab++ to navigate through filter controls once the drawer is open.

### Upload and Export

File operations currently use mouse/click interactions:

- **Upload:** Click the Upload button in the toolbar
- **Export:** Click the Apply & Export button

**No keyboard shortcuts available** for these critical actions (yet).

!!! tip "Future Enhancement"
    Keyboard shortcuts for upload and export are being considered for future releases.

## Accessibility Notes

### Screen Reader Support

Keyboard shortcuts work alongside screen reader software:

- All interactive elements are keyboard-accessible via Tab
- Focus indicators show where you are
- ARIA labels provide context for controls

### Keyboard-Only Navigation

You can navigate the entire app without a mouse:

1. **Tab** through interactive elements
2. **Enter** or **Space** to activate buttons
3. **Arrow keys** to navigate within dropdowns and lists
4. **Esc** to close dialogs and collapse boxes

2. **++d++** - Toggle into Donut Mode
3. Review center box employees
4. **++esc++** - Collapse box when done
5. **++d++** - Toggle back to Grid View

### Zoom During Presentations

2. **++ctrl+plus++** - Zoom in to focus on specific boxes
3. **++esc++** - Collapse expanded boxes between sections
4. **++f11++** - Exit full-screen when done

### Fast Documentation Flow

## Troubleshooting

### Shortcut Not Working?

**Check These Common Issues:**

1. **Browser conflict** - Some browsers override certain shortcuts
   - Example: Ctrl+T opens new tab instead
   - Solution: Use the on-screen controls instead

2. **Focus is elsewhere** - Shortcuts work based on focus
   - Example: D key won't work if you're typing in a text field
   - Solution: Click outside the field first

3. **Session not active** - Some shortcuts require an active session
   - Example: D key needs a loaded file
   - Solution: Upload a file first

4. **Wrong modifier key** - Using Ctrl on Mac or Cmd on Windows won't work
   - Solution: Use Cmd on macOS, Ctrl on Windows/Linux

### Browser-Specific Notes

**Chrome/Edge:**

- All shortcuts work as documented
- F11 full-screen works perfectly

**Firefox:**

- All shortcuts work as documented
- Some Ctrl+Scroll zoom may conflict with browser zoom

**Safari:**

- Cmd key shortcuts work as expected
- F11 may be reserved for Show Desktop on macOS (use on-screen button instead)
