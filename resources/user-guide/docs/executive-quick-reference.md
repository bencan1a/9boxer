## 5-Minute Executive Workflow

Follow this fast workflow to assess talent health and identify critical issues:

### Minute 1: Load Data and View Distribution

1. **Open 9Boxer** and load your current talent data
2. **Scan the grid visually** - Notice where employees cluster
3. **Quick assessment:** Do you have a balanced spread or heavy clustering?

**What to look for immediately:**
- Top-right corner (Stars) - Should have some employees, not empty
- Center box - Should be largest but not overwhelming (not 80% of workforce)
- Bottom-left corner - Should be small (under-performers and new hires)

---

### Minute 2: Check Statistics Dashboard

1. **Click Statistics tab** (third tab in right panel)
2. **Review summary cards** showing:
   - Total employee count
   - Percentage in High/Medium/Low Performance
   - Percentage in High/Medium/Low Potential
   - Distribution across 9 boxes

**Quick health indicators:**
- **Healthy:** 10-15% in Stars, 50-60% in middle tier
- **Warning:** <5% Stars (succession risk) or >70% in center box (poor differentiation)
- **Critical:** >30% in bottom boxes (performance crisis)

---

### Minute 3: Review Intelligence Insights

1. **Click Intelligence tab** (fourth tab)
2. **Check quality score** at top (0-100 scale)
3. **Scan for red anomalies** requiring immediate attention

**Quality score interpretation:**
- **90-100:** Excellent - well-calibrated ratings
- **75-89:** Good - minor issues only
- **60-74:** Fair - review recommended
- **<60:** Poor/Critical - calibration needed before decisions

**Red flags to investigate:**
- Manager leniency bias (one manager rates everyone high)
- Department gaps (one function has no stars)
- Location disparities (one office significantly different)

![Intelligence tab showing critical alert with red warning indicator, low quality score, and multiple anomaly cards highlighted for immediate attention, indicating significant rating inconsistencies requiring calibration review before finalizing performance assessments](images/screenshots/workflow/intelligence-summary-needs-attention.png)

---

### Minute 4: Filter to Critical Segments

Apply strategic filters to view key populations:

**Leadership Pipeline:**
1. Click **Filters button**
2. Select **Job Level: Director, VP, Executive**
3. Review distribution - do you have enough Stars at senior levels?

**Succession Candidates:**
1. Click **Filters**
2. Select **Grid Position: 8 and 9** (High Potential)
3. Review count - is your pipeline sufficient?

**Flight Risks:**
1. Click **Filters**
2. Check **"Flight Risk" flag**
3. Combine with **High Retention Priority** to see critical retention issues

---

### Minute 5: Export Key Insights

1. **Take screenshot** of grid for board presentation
2. **Export data** via File > Apply Changes to Excel
3. **Note top 3 issues** identified for discussion

**Typical executive takeaways:**
- Leadership bench strength assessment
- Succession pipeline health
- Critical retention risks
- Distribution imbalances requiring HR attention

---

## Dashboard View: Statistics + Intelligence

The right panel gives you two strategic views in one place:

### Statistics Tab: Distribution Health

**What it shows:**
- Breakdown of employees by performance and potential
- Visual bar chart of distribution
- Percentage in each of the 9 boxes

**How to use it:**
1. **Scan the chart** - Does it look balanced or skewed?
2. **Check percentages** - Compare to healthy benchmarks
3. **Identify gaps** - Too few in top row? Too many in bottom?

**Healthy distribution benchmarks:**

| Category | Target % | What It Indicates |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| Stars (Position 9) | 10-15% | Strong succession pipeline |
| High Potential (Positions 7-9) | 20-30% | Adequate future leaders |
| Core Performers (Position 5) | 40-50% | Stable workforce backbone |
| Under-Performers (Positions 1, 4, 7) | <15% | Manageable performance issues |

---

### Intelligence Tab: Risk Detection

**What it shows:**
- Overall quality score (0-100)
- Anomaly detection (manager bias, department gaps, location disparities)
- Statistical outliers requiring investigation

**How to use it:**
1. **Check quality score** - Below 75? Investigate anomalies
2. **Review red/yellow cards** - Each represents a potential issue
3. **Click "View Affected Employees"** to drill into specific problems
4. **Share anomalies with CHRO** for calibration follow-up

**Common executive concerns Intelligence detects:**
- Manager rating inconsistency across the organization
- Department talent gaps (one function has no succession candidates)
- Location-based bias (one office rates significantly higher/lower)
- New hire rating inflation (premature high-potential ratings)

---

## Key Metrics to Monitor

Track these metrics quarterly to assess talent health trends:

### 1. Leadership Bench Strength

**Metric:** Percentage of workforce in High Potential (Positions 7, 8, 9)

**Healthy range:** 20-30%

**How to measure:**
1. View Statistics tab
2. Add percentages for top row (Positions 7, 8, 9)
3. Track trend over time

**Red flags:**
- **<15%:** Insufficient leadership pipeline, succession risk
- **>40%:** Grade inflation, unrealistic ratings

**Action:** If below target, increase leadership development programs and identify hidden high-potential employees.

---

### 2. Star Retention Rate

**Metric:** Percentage of Stars (Position 9) retained quarter-over-quarter

**Healthy range:** >90% retention

**How to measure:**
1. Export current quarter data
2. Compare Star employee names to previous quarter
3. Calculate: (Stars retained / Stars last quarter) × 100

**Red flags:**
- Losing more than 10% of Stars per quarter
- Stars leaving for competitors
- Stars downgraded to lower boxes (performance decline)

**Action:** Review compensation, engagement, and development opportunities for Stars. Implement retention strategies.

---

### 3. Distribution Balance Score

**Metric:** Coefficient of variation in distribution across 9 boxes

**Healthy range:** Employees spread across multiple boxes, not clustered in one

**How to measure:**
1. View Statistics tab distribution chart
2. Visual assessment: Are employees concentrated in 1-2 boxes or spread across 5-7 boxes?

**Red flags:**
- >70% in center box (poor differentiation)
- <5% in top-right Stars (succession risk)
- >25% in bottom boxes (performance crisis)

**Action:** Calibration needed to improve differentiation and rating accuracy.

---

### 4. Performance Management Load

**Metric:** Percentage of workforce in bottom-left quadrant (Positions 1, 4, 7)

**Healthy range:** 10-20%

**How to measure:**
1. View Statistics tab
2. Sum percentages for Positions 1, 4, and 7 (Low Performance column)

**Red flags:**
- **>25%:** Significant performance issues, hiring problems, or harsh raters
- **<5%:** Possible leniency bias, under-reporting problems

**Action:** If high, review hiring practices and performance management effectiveness. If low, validate that managers are rating honestly.

---

### 5. Succession Coverage Ratio

**Metric:** Number of succession candidates (Positions 8-9) per critical role

**Healthy range:** 2-3 candidates per critical role

**How to measure:**
1. Filter to High Potential (Positions 8-9)
2. Filter to relevant job levels (Directors, VPs)
3. Count candidates and divide by number of critical roles

**Red flags:**
- <1 candidate per role (no backup if leader leaves)
- 0 candidates for C-suite roles (board governance risk)

**Action:** Accelerate leadership development, consider external hiring for key roles.

---

## Red Flags to Watch For

Intelligence and Statistics reveal warning signs executives should investigate:

### Critical Red Flags (Immediate Action)

**1. Empty Top-Right Corner (No Stars)**

**What it means:** No employees with both high performance and high potential.

**Business risk:**
- Zero succession candidates for leadership roles
- Retention risk if high performers exist but aren't recognized
- Possible hiring or development failure

**What to do:**
1. Filter to High Potential (Positions 7-9) - do you have ANY future leaders?
2. Check if Stars are mis-categorized in other boxes (run Donut Mode)
3. Review hiring and development strategies
4. Discuss with CHRO: Is this real or a rating calibration issue?

---

**2. Quality Score Below 60 (Critical)**

**What it means:** Significant rating inconsistencies detected by statistical analysis.

**Business risk:**
- Unreliable data for succession and promotion decisions
- Potential discrimination or bias in ratings
- Manager calibration failure

**What to do:**
1. Review Intelligence anomalies (red cards)
2. Identify which managers/departments have issues
3. Require calibration sessions before finalizing ratings
4. Do not make promotion or succession decisions until recalibrated

---

**3. >30% Flight Risk in Stars**

**What it means:** High number of top performers at risk of leaving.

**Business risk:**
- Succession pipeline collapse
- Competitive talent loss
- Institutional knowledge drain

**What to do:**
1. Filter to Stars + Flight Risk flag
2. Review each employee individually
3. Implement immediate retention interventions
4. Assess compensation competitiveness
5. Identify root causes (manager issues, lack of growth, compensation)

---

### Warning Red Flags (Plan Action)

**4. >70% in Center Box (Core Performers)**

**What it means:** Poor differentiation, everyone rated "medium."

**Business risk:**
- Can't identify true stars or under-performers
- Development resources spread too thin
- Promotion decisions lack data

**What to do:**
1. Run Donut Mode to force differentiation
2. Require managers to recalibrate using forced distribution
3. Clarify rating criteria with managers
4. Validate ratings in calibration sessions

---

**5. Manager Leniency/Harshness Bias Detected**

**What it means:** One manager rates significantly higher or lower than peers.

**Business risk:**
- Unfair ratings leading to employee relations issues
- Distorted promotion pipeline
- Compensation inequity

**What to do:**
1. Intelligence flags specific managers - review their teams
2. Compare manager's ratings to peer managers
3. Conduct cross-manager calibration sessions
4. Provide manager training on rating standards

---

**6. Zero Employees in Performance Improvement (Low Performance)**

**What it means:** Either no performance issues OR managers avoiding difficult ratings.

**Business risk:**
- Performance problems hidden until crisis
- Lack of honest feedback
- Potential legal risk (no documentation)

**What to do:**
1. Validate with HR: Are there truly no performance issues?
2. Review recent terminations - were they rated Low before exit?
3. Train managers on honest performance conversations
4. Require documentation for all Low ratings

- "We've identified flight risk in 4 of our 12 Stars and implemented targeted retention plans."
- "Distribution shows healthy differentiation with 12% Stars and 48% Core Performers."

**Avoid:**
- "We have some people in boxes." (too vague)
- "The 9-box grid shows..." (boards don't care about the tool)
- "Manager X rates differently than Manager Y." (too tactical)

---

### Anticipate Board Questions

**Common questions executives should be ready to answer:**

1. **"How many succession candidates do we have for the CEO role?"**
   - Filter to Position 9, Job Level: Executive or VP
   - Name 2-3 candidates with brief readiness assessment

2. **"What's our plan for employees in the bottom-left box?"**
   - Performance improvement plans in progress
   - Timeline for improvement or exit decisions
   - Root cause analysis (hiring, onboarding, management)

3. **"How do we compare to industry benchmarks?"**
   - Research industry averages (typically 10-15% Stars)
   - Show your distribution vs. benchmark
   - Explain variances (growth stage, talent strategy, industry norms)

4. **"What are we doing to retain our Stars?"**
   - Compensation review and market benchmarking
   - Development and stretch assignments
   - Career path discussions
   - Succession role identification

5. **"How confident are we in these ratings?"**
   - Reference Intelligence quality score
   - Describe calibration process (how many sessions, who participated)
   - Note any remaining uncertainties or areas for improvement
