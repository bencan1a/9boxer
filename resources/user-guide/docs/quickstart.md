## Step 1: Prepare Your File (30 seconds)

Your Excel file needs **4 columns** with these exact names:

| Employee ID | Worker | Performance | Potential |
|-------------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| 1001 | Sarah Chen | High | High |
| 1002 | Marcus Johnson | Medium | High |
| 1003 | Emma Rodriguez | High | Medium |

**Column requirements:**

- Names are **case-sensitive** - capitalize first letters exactly as shown
- Performance and Potential must be: `Low`, `Medium`, or `High`
