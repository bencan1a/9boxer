# Common Decision Points

Stuck on a decision? This guide addresses frequent questions about which feature to use and when.

---

## "Should I use Filters or Search?"

### Use Search when:

✅ **You know the person's name**
- Looking for one specific employee
- Want to quickly locate someone on the grid
- Need to verify someone's current position

**How it works:** Type the name, person is highlighted instantly

---

### Use Filters when:

✅ **You know the criteria but not specific names**
- "Show me all High Performers"
- "I want to review the Engineering department"
- "Display only Manager-level employees"

✅ **You want to see multiple people at once**
- Review all ICs across the org
- Compare departments side-by-side
- Focus calibration on specific groups

**How it works:** Select criteria, grid shows only matching employees

---

### Use Both when:

✅ **Narrow down then find**
- Filter to "Engineering" then search for "John Smith"
- Focus on "High Potential" then search for specific person

---

## "Statistics vs. Donut Mode - which one?"

### Use Statistics when:

✅ **You want a quick health check**
- "Is my distribution balanced?"
- "Do I have enough Stars for succession?"
- "Are too many people rated High?"

✅ **Preparing reports for stakeholders**
- Executive presentations
- Board reporting
- HR metrics

✅ **Before starting any analysis**
- Always check Statistics first to understand overall state

**Output:** Distribution table, percentages, visual chart

**Time:** 2 minutes

---

### Use Donut Mode when:

✅ **You suspect the center box is overcrowded**
- More than 50% in position 5
- "Core Talent" feels like a catch-all
- Managers avoiding tough rating decisions

✅ **Validating individual placements**
- "Does Sarah really belong in the center?"
- "Is Tom actually a hidden star?"
- Quality-checking before calibration

✅ **Preparing calibration discussion topics**
- Identify borderline employees
- Find people trending up or down
- Challenge "safe" middle ratings

**Output:** Exploratory placements, discussion points, validation insights

**Time:** 15-20 minutes for full exercise

---

### Use Both when:

✅ **Comprehensive calibration prep**
1. Statistics → Check if center box is overcrowded (>50%)
2. Donut Mode → Validate those center box placements
3. Statistics again → See if your donut findings suggest redistribution needs

---

## "When should I add Notes?"

### Always add notes when:

✅ **Making changes during calibration meetings**
- Document consensus decisions
- Capture stakeholder input
- Record discussion points

**Example:** "Calibration 2024-Q4: Team agreed to move to High Potential based on project leadership and 360 feedback"

---

✅ **Moving someone multiple boxes (big changes)**
- Position 3 → Position 9 (major promotion)
- Position 9 → Position 5 (performance decline)
- Any move across 2+ boxes

**Example:** "Performance declined from Star to Core after role change - skill gap identified, providing training"

---

✅ **Borderline or controversial ratings**
- High Performer vs. Star decisions
- Someone on the edge of two boxes
- Ratings that might be questioned

**Example:** "High performance but not yet Star - needs to demonstrate sustained excellence over full year"

---

✅ **Performance concerns**
- Any downward movements
- Potential issues or risks
- Development needs

**Example:** "Moved to Medium performance due to missed deadlines in Q3-Q4. Providing project management coaching."

---

### Consider adding notes when:

✅ **Recent promotions or role changes**

**Example:** "Promoted to Team Lead Q1 2025 - demonstrating leadership skills, moved to Medium Potential"

---

✅ **Correcting errors from initial upload**

**Example:** "Corrected typo from original file - should have been High Performance not Medium"

---

✅ **Succession planning decisions**

**Example:** "Identified as backup for Director role - needs 12 months development in strategic planning"

---

### Skip notes when:

❌ **Just learning the interface**
- Practicing drag-and-drop
- Exploring features
- Not making real decisions yet

❌ **Using Donut Mode for private validation**
- Unless you want to capture your reasoning
- Donut notes are separate anyway

❌ **Obvious or temporary changes**
- Moving someone back to original position immediately
- Testing how drag-and-drop works

---

## "Export now or after more changes?"

### Export immediately when:

✅ **You've finished your work session**
- All changes made
- All notes added
- Ready to share results

---

✅ **Before uploading a new file**
- Export current work before loading new data
- Each upload starts a fresh session

---

✅ **After calibration meetings**
- Capture decisions while fresh
- Create audit trail
- Share with attendees

---

✅ **Need to share results with others**
- Sending to HR, managers, leadership
- Creating reports
- Distributing updated ratings

---

### Wait to export when:

✅ **You're still making changes**
- Mid-session, more employees to review
- Not all notes added yet
- Still exploring options

---

✅ **You want to review your changes first**
- Check Changes tab to verify all moves
- Ensure notes are clear
- Double-check nothing was missed

---

### Export multiple times when:

✅ **Long calibration sessions**
- Save progress every 30 minutes
- Create backup in case of issues
- Name files with timestamps

**Example filenames:**
- `calibration-2024-12-20-progress.xlsx`
- `calibration-2024-12-20-final.xlsx`

---

✅ **Before and after comparison needed**
- Export pre-meeting baseline
- Export post-meeting final
- Show impact of calibration

---

✅ **Different stakeholder views**
- Export with filters for department heads
- Export full data for HR
- Export summary for executives

---

## "Should I use Exclusions or just ignore those employees?"

### Use Exclusions when:

✅ **Employees shouldn't be rated yet**
- New hires in first 90 days
- Recent transfers still ramping
- People not yet in role long enough

---

✅ **Someone is temporarily unavailable**
- On leave (parental, medical, sabbatical)
- Temporarily assigned to different org
- Gap coverage or interim roles

---

✅ **Data quality issues**
- Employee has missing information
- Waiting for manager input
- Incomplete performance data

---

✅ **Focused calibration sessions**
- "Today we're only calibrating ICs"
- Exclude all managers temporarily
- Re-include them in next session

**Benefit:** Excluded employees don't clutter your view, but remain in your data for later

---

### Just ignore (don't exclude) when:

✅ **They're rated correctly and don't need discussion**
- You're focusing on High Performers
- This person is in the middle and fine
- No changes needed, just not your focus

✅ **They're part of overall distribution**
- You want accurate statistics
- Calibration needs full picture
- They affect percentages and balance

**Benefit:** See the complete talent landscape

---

## "Regular Changes vs. Donut Changes - which do I use?"

### Use Regular Changes (normal mode) when:

✅ **Making actual rating decisions**
- Performance review updates
- Calibration adjustments
- Real promotions or declines

✅ **Changes will be official**
- Export goes to HRIS
- Managers communicate to employees
- Impacts compensation or development plans

✅ **You're sure about the change**
- Consensus reached
- Evidence supports it
- Ready to commit

**Effect:** Updates Performance/Potential ratings, appears in export as modified employee

---

### Use Donut Changes (donut mode) when:

✅ **Exploring "what-if" scenarios**
- "Where would they go if not in center?"
- Testing calibration hypotheses
- Validating placements

✅ **Preparing discussion topics**
- Identify borderline cases
- Find employees to talk about
- Challenge safe ratings

✅ **Private validation exercise**
- Just you reviewing placements
- Before group calibration
- Personal quality check

**Effect:** No impact on actual ratings, tracked separately in donut columns

---

### Use Both when:

✅ **Full calibration workflow**
1. Use Donut Mode to identify discussion topics (prep)
2. Discuss those employees in calibration meeting
3. Switch to regular mode to make actual changes (during meeting)
4. Export final ratings with notes (after meeting)

---

## "Intelligence tab vs. just looking at the grid?"

### Use Intelligence when:

✅ **You need data-driven insights**
- Too many employees to eyeball patterns
- Want statistical validation of bias
- Need to spot outliers automatically

✅ **Comparing across groups**
- Manager A vs. Manager B ratings
- Department patterns
- Location or tenure differences

✅ **Preparing for calibration**
- Find specific anomalies to discuss
- Identify managers with rating bias
- Spot problematic patterns

✅ **Large organizations (50+ employees)**
- Can't manually spot all issues
- Need automated analysis
- Want comprehensive review

**Output:** Specific alerts, statistical comparisons, flagged anomalies

---

### Just look at the grid when:

✅ **Small team (<30 employees)**
- Easy to see whole picture visually
- Know everyone personally
- Patterns are obvious

✅ **Making quick changes**
- One or two people to move
- Not analyzing distribution
- Just updating ratings

✅ **Visual preference**
- You learn better visually
- Grid layout makes sense to you
- Don't need statistical proof

---

## "Should I filter or just scroll?"

### Use Filters when:

✅ **Many employees to review**
- 50+ employees total
- Boxes are crowded
- Hard to find people visually

✅ **Systematic review needed**
- "Review all managers first, then ICs"
- "Check Engineering, then Sales, then Operations"
- One cohort at a time

✅ **Focused calibration**
- Discussing one department today
- Reviewing specific performance levels
- Comparing similar roles

---

### Just scroll/browse when:

✅ **Small dataset (<30 employees)**
- Everyone visible on one screen
- No crowding
- Quick visual scan works

✅ **Exploring the data**
- First time looking at distribution
- Getting a feel for the grid
- Not looking for anyone specific

✅ **Checking a specific box**
- "Who's in the Stars box?"
- Click the box to expand
- Review that group

---

## Quick Decision Matrix

| Question | Option A | Option B | Recommendation |
|----------|----------|----------|----------------|
| Find one person? | Search by name | Filter by criteria | Search (faster) |
| See distribution? | Statistics tab | Just look at grid | Statistics (precise numbers) |
| Validate center box? | Donut Mode | Review manually | Donut Mode (systematic) |
| Document a change? | Add note | Skip it | Add note (future clarity) |
| Save your work? | Export now | Wait until later | Export now (prevent loss) |
| Hide some people? | Exclusions | Filters | Exclusions (individuals) / Filters (groups) |
| Make real changes? | Regular mode | Donut mode | Regular mode (affects ratings) |
| Find rating bias? | Intelligence tab | Manual comparison | Intelligence (data-driven) |
| Focus on one team? | Filters | Scroll through all | Filters (less clutter) |

---

## Decision-Making Tips

### Start Broad, Then Narrow

1. **Statistics** - Overall health check
2. **Intelligence** - Find specific problems
3. **Filters** - Focus on relevant group
4. **Donut Mode** - Validate borderline cases
5. **Regular Changes** - Make actual decisions

---

### When in Doubt

**Not sure if you should add a note?** → Add it (better too many than too few)

**Not sure if you should export?** → Export (you can always export again)

**Not sure if someone should be excluded?** → Don't exclude (you can always filter them out visually)

**Not sure between two boxes?** → Use Donut Mode to explore, then decide in regular mode
