## General Usage

### Review Before Moving

Before adjusting an employee's rating:

- Click the employee tile to view their details
- Check their timeline to see previous movements
- Review their job level, manager, and organizational context
- Consider their trajectory (improving vs. declining)

This helps ensure rating changes are informed and justified.

### Use Filters Strategically

Don't try to review everyone at once:

- Focus on one department, level, or manager at a time
- Use filters to narrow your view to manageable groups
- Clear filters between different focus areas
- Apply multiple filters to drill down to specific cohorts

Example: Filter by "High Potential" + "Engineering" to review engineering's future leaders.

### Check the Timeline

The timeline in the Details tab shows an employee's complete movement history:

- Review when and why they were moved previously
- Look for patterns (consistently moving up? slipping down?)
- Consider trajectory when making new placements
- Use historical context to inform current decisions

### Export Frequently

!!! danger "Critical: No Auto-Save"
    The application does NOT auto-save. Export regularly to avoid losing work!

**Export guidelines:**

- **Export before closing** - Always save your work before closing the app
- **Export during long sessions** - Save after every major set of changes
- **Export at milestones** - Save quarterly, after calibration sessions, or before major meetings
- **Export for backups** - Create backup versions before making experimental changes

Learn about naming conventions and file management in the [Exporting Your Changes guide](exporting.md).

### Document Your Decisions

Add notes in the Changes tab to explain why each employee was moved:

- Be specific about the reason (promotion, performance improvement, role change, etc.)
- Keep notes concise but informative
- Use consistent terminology across your team
- Notes are included in Excel exports for audit trails

Example: "Promoted to manager role in Q4, strong leadership skills demonstrated"

Learn about the change tracking system in the [Tracking Changes guide](tracking-changes.md).

### Review the Changes Tab

Before exporting, always check the Changes tab:

- Verify all employee movements are correct
- Ensure all movements have notes documenting the rationale
- Review for any unintended changes
- Confirm the net change count matches expectations

## Conducting Performance Reviews

### 1. Start with Stars

Identify and confirm your top talent first:

- Review all employees currently in the "Stars" box (High Performance, High Potential)
- Verify they truly deserve this rating
- Look for high performers in other boxes who should be stars
- Ensure stars are prioritized for retention and development

**Why start with stars?**

- Establishes the high bar for performance and potential
- Helps calibrate what "excellent" looks like
- Ensures top talent is properly recognized
- Sets the benchmark for rating other employees

### 2. Review Under-Performers

Determine who needs improvement plans or performance management:

- Focus on the bottom-left boxes (low performance, low potential)
- Verify these ratings are accurate and fair
- Identify who needs performance improvement plans
- Determine if role fit is an issue
- Consider coaching, development, or other interventions

### 3. Look for Patterns

Are certain departments or managers consistently higher or lower?

- Use [Filters](filters.md) to view specific managers or departments
- Check the [Intelligence tab](statistics.md) for anomaly detection
- Compare distributions across teams
- Identify potential rating bias (leniency or harshness)

**Common patterns to watch for:**

- One manager rates everyone as "High" (leniency bias)
- One department has no stars (under-rating or talent gap)
- New hires rated as "High Potential" (premature ratings)
- One location consistently lower (harsh raters or performance issues)

### 4. Calibrate Ratings

Ensure ratings are consistent across teams:

- Hold calibration meetings with multiple managers
- Compare similar employees across teams
- Ensure everyone uses the same performance/potential definitions
- Adjust ratings to achieve consistency
- Use [Intelligence insights](statistics.md) to guide calibration

### 5. Document Decisions

Add notes during the review to capture rationale:

- Document why each rating change was made
- Reference specific achievements, projects, or concerns
- Note development plans or promotion timelines
- Maintain transparency in talent decisions

### 6. Plan Development

Use the grid to identify training and succession needs:

- **Stars** - Prepare for advancement, succession planning
- **High Potential** - Fast-track development, leadership training
- **Core Performers** - Maintain engagement, skill development
- **Under-Performers** - Performance improvement plans, coaching

### 7. Check Intelligence

Review anomalies before finalizing placements:

- Open the [Intelligence tab](statistics.md) to see statistical analysis
- Check for red/yellow highlighted anomalies
- Investigate significant outliers
- Re-calibrate if bias is detected

### 8. Review Change Tracker

Use the Changes tab to ensure all rating changes are documented:

- Verify every movement has a note
- Check that notes are specific and professional
- Ensure the change count matches your expectations
- Export changes for HR records and audit trails

## Collaboration

### Zoom and Full-Screen Controls

Adjust the view for different scenarios using the zoom controls in the bottom-left corner:

**Zoom In/Out:**

- Click the **+** button to zoom in (makes everything larger)
- Click the **−** button to zoom out (fits more on screen)
- Click the **reset** button to return to 100%
- Current zoom level displays next to the buttons (e.g., "125%")

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**

- `Ctrl` + `+` (or `Cmd` + `+` on Mac) - Zoom in
- `Ctrl` + `-` (or `Cmd` + `-` on Mac) - Zoom out

- `Ctrl` + scroll wheel - Zoom in/out smoothly

**Full-Screen Mode:**

- Click the **full-screen** button for presentation mode
- Press `F11` to toggle full-screen
- Press `Esc` to exit full-screen
- Perfect for large room calibration sessions with projectors

**When to Use Zoom:**

- **Zoom out (75%-90%)** - Review many employees at once, get overview of distribution
- **Default (100%)** - Normal working view
- **Zoom in (110%-150%)** - Focus on specific employees, easier to read in bright rooms
- **Zoom in + Full-screen** - Large room presentations on big screens

**Tips:**

- Your zoom level persists between sessions
- Zoom controls hide on small screens
- Use full-screen for distraction-free calibration meetings
- Combine zoom with filters to focus on specific groups

### Share Screen During Meetings

Review the grid with managers during calibration sessions:

- Use zoom and full-screen controls for better visibility
- Use filters to focus on specific teams or levels
- Discuss movements in real-time
- Add notes collaboratively during the meeting
- Export immediately after the meeting for record-keeping

### Discuss Movements

Explain your rationale for any changes:

- Reference specific achievements or concerns
- Use data from the Details tab (timeline, org hierarchy)
- Discuss trajectory and development plans
- Build consensus on rating decisions

### Export Versions

Save before/after files for comparison:

- Export before calibration meeting: `talent_before_calibration.xlsx`
- Export after calibration meeting: `talent_after_calibration.xlsx`
- Compare files to see what changed
- Maintain audit trail of decisions

### Keep Milestone Records

Export at key points to track progress over time:

- **Quarterly exports** - Track seasonal changes
- **Annual exports** - Year-over-year comparison
- **Calibration sessions** - Document meeting outcomes
- **Performance cycles** - Before and after reviews

### Use Consistent Criteria

Ensure all reviewers use the same definitions:

- Define what "High Performance" means for your organization
- Establish clear criteria for "High Potential"
- Use consistent examples across teams
- Document definitions in shared guidelines

## Data Quality

### Verify Uploads

After uploading a file, check:

- Employee count in the top bar matches your expectations
- All required columns were recognized
- No missing employees (check with filters cleared)
- Distribution looks reasonable (check Statistics tab)

### Update Regularly

Re-upload with the latest employee data before each session:

- Use the most recent export as your starting point
- Include new hires, terminations, and role changes
- Verify all data is current before making new changes
- Avoid using stale or outdated employee data

### Clean Data First

Fix any data issues in Excel before uploading:

- Ensure consistent spelling of names
- Fix missing or incorrect job levels
- Standardize department names
- Remove duplicate employees
- Ensure Performance/Potential columns use: Low, Medium, High

**Common data issues to fix:**

- Inconsistent capitalization (e.g., "High" vs. "high")
- Misspelled names or departments
- Missing required columns
- Extra spaces in cells
- Non-Excel file formats (.csv, .txt)

### Backup Originals

Keep a copy of your source file:

- Save a master copy before making any changes
- Store backups in a secure location
- Maintain version history of source files
- Never overwrite your original data

### Validate Exports

After exporting, open the file to verify:

- All changes were saved correctly
- Notes appear in the export
- No data was lost or corrupted
- Column headers are correct
- Performance/Potential ratings updated as expected

## Session Management

### One File at a Time

Uploading a new file replaces the current session completely:

- All current changes are lost if you upload a new file
- Export your work before uploading a different file
- Each upload starts a fresh session
- Cannot merge data from multiple files

### Export Before Closing

All changes are lost if you close without exporting:

!!! danger "No Auto-Save"
    There is NO auto-save feature. You MUST export to save your work.

**Prevent data loss:**

- Export immediately after making important changes
- Export before closing the application
- Export before uploading a new file
- Export before breaks during long sessions

### No Auto-Save

You must manually click "Apply" to save changes:

- Changes are stored in browser memory until exported
- Closing the app without exporting = all changes lost
- Refreshing the browser = all changes lost (web version)
- Uploading a new file = all changes lost

**Best practice:** Export frequently and save exports to a secure folder.

### Restart Fresh

If something seems wrong, restart the app and re-upload:

- Close the application completely
- Reopen and upload your most recent export
- Verify data loads correctly
- Resume work from the last saved state

---

## Data Security

### Local Processing

All employee data stays on your computer:

- No data is sent to external servers
- All processing happens in the application locally
- No cloud storage or online backups
- Your data remains private and secure

**Desktop app benefits:**

- Fully offline operation
- No internet connection required
- Complete data privacy
- No external dependencies

### Secure Storage

Store exported files in a secure location:

- Use a password-protected folder
- Store on encrypted drives
- Use your organization's secure file storage
- Follow company data security policies

### Clean Up Exports

Delete old exported files when no longer needed:

- Remove obsolete versions to reduce data exposure
- Keep only necessary milestone versions
- Securely delete sensitive files (don't just move to trash)
- Follow data retention policies

### Careful Sharing

These files contain sensitive employee performance data:

- Only share with authorized personnel
- Use secure file transfer methods (encrypted email, secure file sharing)
- Redact sensitive information if needed
- Track who has access to exported files
- Follow company data privacy policies

### Access Control

Limit who can access the application and exported files:

- Restrict application installation to authorized users
- Require authentication if possible
- Monitor who downloads exports
- Audit access to sensitive talent data

## Advanced Workflows

### Use Donut Mode for Validation

Validate that employees in the center box (Core Talent) truly belong there:

1. Activate [Donut Mode](donut-mode.md) to focus on position 5 employees
2. Ask: "If they can't be Medium/Medium, where do they really belong?"
3. Place each employee at their true level
4. Add notes explaining each donut placement
5. Export donut findings for review with leadership
6. Use insights to recalibrate actual ratings in a future session

Follow the complete step-by-step process in the [Donut Mode Exercise guide](donut-mode.md).

### Start with Filters for Large Datasets

When working with hundreds or thousands of employees:

- Don't try to review everyone at once
- Filter by department, manager, or job level first
- Review one manageable group at a time
- Export after each group to save progress
- Use Statistics tab to track overall distribution

### Review Intelligence Insights

Before finalizing any major changes:

- Check the [Intelligence tab](statistics.md) for anomalies
- Investigate any red/yellow highlighted outliers
- Validate that patterns make sense
- Re-calibrate if bias is detected
- Ensure fair and consistent ratings across the organization

### Combine Regular and Donut Changes

You can use both modes in the same session:

1. Make regular rating changes to reflect actual performance/potential
2. Activate Donut Mode to validate center box placements
3. Add notes to both regular and donut changes
4. Export once - both regular and donut data appear in separate columns
5. Review both datasets side-by-side in the exported Excel file
