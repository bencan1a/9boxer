# Understanding the 9-Box Grid

Learn how the 9-box talent grid is organized, what each position means, and how to interpret employee placements. This guide explains the grid layout, position labels, and the strategic meaning of each box.

## When to Use This

### Common Scenarios

You'll want to reference this guide when:

- **First-time users** - Learn what the 9-box methodology is and what each position means
- **Explaining to stakeholders** - Share grid definitions when presenting talent data to leadership
- **Training others** - Help new managers understand how to interpret the grid and place employees
- **Making placement decisions** - Reference position definitions to decide where an employee truly belongs ([see Making Your First Changes](workflows/making-changes.md))
- **Calibrating with peers** - Use shared definitions to ensure consistent ratings across teams

### Related Workflows

- [Getting Started](getting-started.md) - Start here after uploading your data to understand what you're looking at
- [Preparing for Talent Calibration](workflows/talent-calibration.md) - Reference position meanings during calibration discussions
- [Donut Mode](donut-mode.md) - Validate that Position 5 (Core Talent) employees truly belong there

### Real-World Example

> 📋 **Scenario**
>
> New manager Priya has 15 employees to rate for the first time. She reads Understanding the Grid to learn that Position 9 (Stars) should be 10-15% of workforce (not 50%) and that Position 5 (Core Talent) is for solid, reliable performers - not everyone who's "just okay." This helps her avoid grade inflation and make accurate placements.

## Grid Layout

The 9-box grid is a 3×3 matrix that plots employees based on two dimensions:

- **X-axis (horizontal)**: **Performance** - Current performance in their role
- **Y-axis (vertical)**: **Potential** - Future growth capacity and leadership capability

Each axis has three levels: **Low**, **Medium**, and **High**, creating 9 distinct positions.

### Visual Grid Structure

```
                 LOW               MEDIUM            HIGH
              PERFORMANCE        PERFORMANCE      PERFORMANCE

HIGH          Enigma/              High            Stars
POTENTIAL     Question Mark       Potential       (Top Talent)
              Position 7          Position 8       Position 9

MEDIUM        Under-              Core             High
POTENTIAL     Performer           Performer        Performer
              Position 4          Position 5       Position 6

LOW           Too New/            Solid            Strong
POTENTIAL     Problem             Performer        Performer
              Position 1          Position 2       Position 3
```

### Axis Definitions

**Performance (X-axis):**

- **Low** - Below expectations, needs improvement
- **Medium** - Meets expectations, solid contribution
- **High** - Exceeds expectations, outstanding performance

**Potential (Y-axis):**

- **Low** - Limited growth capacity, best suited to current role
- **Medium** - Moderate growth potential, can advance with development
- **High** - High growth capacity, future leader potential

## The 9 Grid Positions

> 📋 **Real-World Scenario**
>
> James is reviewing his leadership team and sees 8 out of 15 employees in Position 9 (Stars). He refers to the grid position definitions and realizes that 53% in the top box indicates grade inflation. Using the position definitions, he recalibrates by asking "Who truly has High Potential for the next level?" and moves 4 employees to Position 6 (High Performers without high potential), creating a more realistic distribution.

Each position on the grid has a specific meaning and strategic implications. Here's a detailed breakdown of all 9 positions:

---

## Color Coding

9Boxer uses visual color coding to help you quickly identify different areas of the grid:

- **Green boxes** (top row) - High potential employees - your future leaders
- **Yellow/Amber boxes** (middle row) - Medium potential employees - solid contributors
- **Orange boxes** (bottom row) - Lower potential or new hires - stable performers or concerns

**Employee Tile Colors:**

- **Blue tiles** - Default appearance for all employees
- **Orange left border** - Employee has been moved (modified in current session)
- **Purple border + ghostly** - Employee has been placed in Donut Mode

---

## Expanding and Collapsing Boxes

When a grid box contains many employees, you can expand it for better viewing:

### How to Expand a Box

1. **Click the expand icon** (⛶) on any box
2. The box expands to show all employees in a larger view
3. **Multi-column layout automatically arranges** employee cards in multiple columns (typically 2-4) depending on your screen size and the number of employees
4. Drag-and-drop continues to work normally

### How to Collapse a Box

1. **Click the collapse icon** (⛶) on the expanded box, or
2. **Press ++esc++** to collapse the currently expanded box

### Multi-Column Layout Benefits

- **More employees visible** without scrolling
- **Responsive grid** that adapts to screen size
- **Easier management** of boxes with many employees
- **Maintains drag-and-drop** functionality

!!! tip "Expansion State Persists"
    The expansion state is remembered during your session. If you expand a box, it stays expanded until you collapse it or restart the application.

## Interpreting Grid Distribution

Understanding your grid distribution helps identify organizational strengths and risks.

### Ideal Distribution (Rough Guideline)

- **10-15% in Stars** (Position 9) - Top talent pipeline
- **15-20% in High Potential** (Positions 7, 8) - Future leaders
- **50-60% in Core/Solid Performers** (Positions 2, 5, 6) - Stable contributors
- **10-20% in Lower Boxes** (Positions 1, 3, 4) - Improvement or stability focus

!!! note "Guidelines, Not Rules"
    These percentages are rough guidelines. Your ideal distribution may vary based on industry, growth stage, and organizational needs.

### Red Flags to Watch For

**Too many in bottom-left (Position 1):**

- Performance issues or poor hiring
- Need for performance management or exits

**Too few in top rows (Positions 7, 8, 9):**

- Succession planning risk
- Limited leadership pipeline
- Retention concerns

**Heavily skewed to one side:**

- Calibration needed across managers
- Potential rating inconsistency

**Very uneven distribution:**

- Possible rating bias
- Lack of differentiation
- Over-reliance on "safe" middle ratings
