# After Calibration: Manager and Employee Conversations

The calibration meeting is over. Ratings are finalized. Your work is done, right?

Wrong. This is where the real work begins.

What happens after calibration determines whether it was valuable organizational development or expensive theater. The decisions you made in that room only matter if they translate into actual conversations, development plans, and action.

This reference covers what comes next: the manager-to-employee conversations, development planning, retention strategies, and coaching managers on their patterns.

## Who Should Read This

**For HR leaders:** Understand what follow-up is required after calibration to make it valuable.

**For managers:** Learn how to communicate calibration outcomes to your team without damaging trust.

**For facilitators:** Know what guidance to provide at the end of calibration sessions.

**For executives:** See what transforms calibration from process compliance into organizational development.

## The 30-Day Rule

Every rating change requires a conversation. Every single one.

Not next quarter. Not when you "get around to it." Within 30 days of calibration. Ideally within 2 weeks.

### Why This Matters

**The trust equation:**

When you calibrate ratings but never communicate them to employees, here's what happens:

**Week 1-2 after calibration:** Employees wonder if the calibration meeting happened. Some managers hint at discussions, others say nothing. Confusion spreads.

**Week 3-4:** Rumors start. "I heard they're changing ratings." "Nobody's telling me anything." Anxiety builds.

**Month 2-3:** Some managers have conversations. Others don't. Employees compare notes and realize they're getting inconsistent treatment.

**Month 4+:** Compensation cycle arrives. Employees see their ratings for the first time in a spreadsheet or a raise letter. No context. No explanation. No warning.

**The damage:**

This sequence destroys trust in three specific ways:

1. **Calibration feels like a secret tribunal** - Decisions about people's careers were made behind closed doors, without their knowledge or input, and nobody told them.

2. **Managers look weak or dishonest** - Either they didn't know the rating changed (weak) or they knew and didn't tell you (dishonest).

3. **Ratings lose meaning** - If the organization can change your rating without telling you, ratings clearly don't matter.

### What the 30-Day Rule Prevents

**When you communicate calibration outcomes within 30 days:**

**Trust is maintained:** Employees see that calibration decisions get communicated transparently and promptly.

**Context gets preserved:** Managers remember the reasoning while it's still fresh.

**Development planning starts immediately:** High potentials get development opportunities, low performers get support, everyone gets clarity.

**Feedback loops close:** Employees can respond to their ratings, ask questions, and understand the why behind the decision.

### The Standard: Within 2 Weeks Is Ideal

**Why 2 weeks?**

- Memory is fresh - managers remember the specific calibration discussions
- Context is intact - the reasoning behind rating changes is still clear
- Development can start - you have time to create plans before next quarter
- Trust is high - employees see that transparency happens quickly

**Why 30 days is the maximum:**

After a month, the calibration context fades. Managers forget the nuances. Other priorities take over. Employees assume nothing is happening. The moment passes.

### Who Needs a Conversation

**Everyone whose rating changed:** Absolutely required. No exceptions.

**High performers whose rating was confirmed:** Strongly recommended. Validation is powerful.

**Medium performers in the center box:** Recommended if you used Donut Mode or had specific discussions about them.

**Low performers:** Absolutely required. They need to know and need a plan.

### What Happens If You Skip This

**Scenario: The Compensation Discovery**

Alex has been rated as a High Performer by their manager all year. In calibration, the group moves Alex to Medium Performance because compared to other High Performers at that level, Alex's achievements don't measure up.

Alex's manager never tells them about the change.

Three months later, Alex gets their annual raise letter. The raise is smaller than expected. Alex asks why.

Manager: "Well, your rating was adjusted in calibration..."

Alex: "When was that decided?"

Manager: "Back in December."

Alex: "And you're telling me now? In March?"

**The damage:**

- Alex feels blindsided and disrespected
- Trust in the manager is damaged ("You knew for three months and said nothing?")
- Trust in calibration is destroyed ("Secret processes deciding my career?")
- Alex starts looking for a new job

**This is preventable.** Have the conversation within 30 days.

## Manager-to-Employee Conversations

This is the hardest part of calibration. Here's how to do it without destroying trust.

### The Core Principle

**Calibration outcomes are not verdicts. They're data points in an ongoing development conversation.**

The way you frame a rating change determines whether the employee hears:

- "The organization is investing in your growth" OR
- "Secret judges decided you're not good enough"

Frame it as the first one. Always.

### How to Explain a Rating Change

#### Lead with Development, Not Judgment

**Don't say:**
"In calibration, we decided you're not actually a High Performer."

**Do say:**
"During calibration, we looked at the full picture of your performance this year and discussed what High Performance looks like at your level across the organization. Based on that discussion, here's where we landed and what it means for your development."

**The difference:**

The first version is a verdict. The second version is a context-setting conversation that leads somewhere productive.

#### Separate the Rating from the Person's Worth

Make it explicit that performance ratings are about job fit and organizational standards, not human value.

**Don't say:**
"You're a Medium Performer."

**Do say:**
"Your rating is Medium Performance, which means you're meeting the expectations for your role. Let me explain what that means and what we're focusing on for your growth."

**The difference:**

"You are" equates the person with the rating. "Your rating is" separates identity from assessment.

#### Use Specific Examples, Not Generalizations

Vague explanations create confusion and defensiveness. Specific examples create clarity.

**Don't say:**
"The group felt you weren't quite at the High Performer level."

**Do say:**
"When we compared your work this year to other High Performers at the Senior Engineer level, we saw a gap in technical leadership. For example, High Performers at your level typically lead architecture decisions that affect multiple teams. Your work this year has been excellent within your team, but you haven't yet taken on that broader leadership. That's what we want to focus on developing."

**The difference:**

The first is a vague group judgment. The second is a specific, actionable observation.

#### Acknowledge the Change Explicitly

If the rating changed from what the employee expected, acknowledge that directly.

**Don't say:**
*Pretend nothing changed or hope they don't notice*

**Do say:**
"I know we've talked about you being on a High Performance trajectory. In calibration, when we compared your work to others at your level across the organization, the rating came out as Medium Performance. I want to talk about why, what it means, and what we're doing next."

**The difference:**

Acknowledgment shows respect. Avoidance shows cowardice.

### Language That Helps vs. Hurts

The words you use matter enormously. Here are direct comparisons.

#### When Explaining the Process

**❌ DON'T:**
"Others didn't agree with my assessment of you."

**✅ DO:**
"During calibration, we looked at the full year and discussed how your achievements compare to expectations at your level."

**Why:** The first sounds like you lost a fight. The second describes a collaborative process.

---

**❌ DON'T:**
"The committee decided..."

**✅ DO:**
"We reviewed your performance alongside peers at your level, and here's what we observed..."

**Why:** "Committee decided" sounds like a secret tribunal. "We reviewed" describes a professional discussion.

---

**❌ DON'T:**
"I fought for you, but they wouldn't budge."

**✅ DO:**
"I shared your accomplishments and advocated for your work. The discussion helped me see how the organization defines High Performance, and here's what we need to focus on."

**Why:** The first makes you a martyr and "them" the enemy. The second shows learning and next steps.

#### When Explaining the Rating

**❌ DON'T:**
"You're just not a High Performer."

**✅ DO:**
"When we compare your work to what High Performance means at your level - things like scope, impact, and leadership - here's where we see the gap..."

**Why:** The first is a label. The second is an assessment with specifics.

---

**❌ DON'T:**
"Everyone in the room agreed you were overrated."

**✅ DO:**
"The calibration discussion helped us see that the bar for High Performance includes [specific criteria], and your work this year focused more on [what they did do]. That's valuable, and it's Medium Performance, not High Performance."

**Why:** The first is humiliating. The second is informative.

---

**❌ DON'T:**
"The data shows you're Medium."

**✅ DO:**
"Looking at your achievements this year and comparing them to the standards for High Performance, here's what we're seeing..."

**Why:** "The data" is impersonal and evasive. "We're seeing" is human and direct.

#### When Discussing Next Steps

**❌ DON'T:**
"You'll need to work harder to get to High Performance."

**✅ DO:**
"Here's what we're focusing on for your growth: [specific skills/behaviors]. Let's build a plan to develop these areas."

**Why:** "Work harder" is vague and implies effort is the issue. Specific development areas are actionable.

---

**❌ DON'T:**
"Maybe next year you'll get there."

**✅ DO:**
"Here's the roadmap to High Performance: [specific milestones]. Let's check in quarterly on progress."

**Why:** "Maybe next year" is dismissive. A roadmap with milestones is actionable and supportive.

---

**❌ DON'T:**
"I can't promise anything about future ratings."

**✅ DO:**
"If you demonstrate [specific achievements] over the next [timeframe], that's what High Performance looks like at your level."

**Why:** The first offers no hope. The second provides a clear path.

### Conversation Examples

Here are three common scenarios with full conversation scripts.

#### Scenario 1: Rating Moved Down

**Context:** Jamie was rated High Performance by their manager. In calibration, the group moved Jamie to Medium Performance because compared to other High Performers at the same level, Jamie's scope was narrower and impact was more localized.

**How the conversation should go:**

---

**Manager:** "Jamie, I want to talk about your performance rating from this year. I know we've discussed you being on a High Performance path, and I want to give you context on where we landed after calibration."

**Jamie:** "Okay..."

**Manager:** "Your final rating is Medium Performance. I know that might be surprising, so let me explain what happened and what it means."

**Jamie:** "I thought I was doing well."

**Manager:** "You are doing well. Medium Performance means you're meeting expectations for your role, which is genuinely valuable. Let me explain the calibration process and what we learned."

"During calibration, we looked at all the Senior Analysts across the organization - your work alongside everyone else at your level. We compared what High Performance looks like at that level. What came up is that High Performers at the Senior Analyst level typically drive initiatives that affect multiple departments, influence strategy decisions, and mentor more junior people."

"Your work this year has been excellent for your team - the customer analysis project was solid, your reports were thorough, and you hit your deadlines consistently. That's exactly what we expect from someone in your role."

"Where we see the gap to High Performance is in cross-functional impact and strategic influence. You're delivering for your team, but you haven't yet taken on the broader organizational initiatives that define High Performance at your level."

**Jamie:** "So what does this mean?"

**Manager:** "It means two things. First, you're doing your job well - Medium Performance is solid, reliable contribution. Second, here's the path to High Performance: we need to get you on projects that affect multiple teams, get you involved in strategic planning conversations, and have you mentor the two new analysts joining next quarter."

"I'm going to make sure you get those opportunities. Let's build a development plan with specific milestones for the next six months."

**Jamie:** "Why didn't you tell me this before calibration?"

**Manager:** "That's a fair question. Honestly, calibration helped me see the organizational bar more clearly. Comparing your work to peers across the organization showed me what the next level looks like. I should have been clearer about those expectations earlier, and I'm going to be more explicit about them going forward."

**Jamie:** "Will this affect my compensation?"

**Manager:** "Your rating is one input into compensation decisions. I can't make promises about specific numbers, but I can tell you that Medium Performance typically results in [describe your org's typical approach]. What I can control is making sure you get the development opportunities to reach High Performance next cycle."

**Jamie:** "Okay. I appreciate you being direct about this."

**Manager:** "I know it's not easy to hear. But I believe you can get to High Performance, and I'm committed to helping you get there. Let's meet next week to build the development plan."

---

**Why this works:**

- Acknowledges the change directly
- Explains the calibration process without blaming others
- Provides specific, actionable feedback
- Frames Medium Performance as meeting expectations, not failure
- Offers a clear path forward with manager support
- Admits manager could have set expectations better earlier

#### Scenario 2: Rating Moved Up

**Context:** Taylor was rated Medium Performance by their manager. In calibration, another manager mentioned Taylor's work on a cross-functional project. The discussion revealed Taylor had more impact than the manager realized. The group moved Taylor to High Performance.

**How the conversation should go:**

---

**Manager:** "Taylor, I want to share some feedback from the calibration session. Your final rating is High Performance."

**Taylor:** "Really? I thought I was on track for Medium."

**Manager:** "So did I, initially. Then during calibration, [Other Manager] mentioned the work you did on the payments redesign project. I knew you contributed to that, but I didn't realize the full scope of what you drove."

"When we talked it through, it became clear you led the technical architecture, coordinated three teams, and delivered ahead of schedule. That's exactly what High Performance looks like at your level."

**Taylor:** "That's great to hear."

**Manager:** "Here's what I learned from this: I wasn't seeing the full picture of your cross-functional impact. That's on me. Going forward, I want to make sure I'm aware of all the work you're doing, not just the projects that directly touch our team."

"The calibration discussion also highlighted that you're ready for more complex challenges. Let's talk about what stretch assignments make sense for you."

**Taylor:** "I appreciate that. I wasn't sure if that project work 'counted' since it wasn't on our team's roadmap."

**Manager:** "It absolutely counts. High Performance means driving impact beyond your immediate team, and you're doing that. Keep doing it, and let's make sure I'm tracking your full scope of work."

---

**Why this works:**

- Delivers good news clearly
- Explains why the rating changed (shows calibration adds value)
- Manager takes accountability for not seeing the full picture
- Validates the employee's work explicitly
- Sets expectation for continued high performance
- Opens conversation about next opportunities

#### Scenario 3: Rating Confirmed

**Context:** Morgan was rated High Performance by their manager. In calibration, the group confirmed the rating - Morgan's achievements clearly meet the High Performance bar. The rating didn't change, but the validation is valuable.

**How the conversation should go:**

---

**Manager:** "Morgan, I want to share feedback from the calibration session. Your rating is High Performance, which you probably expected, but I want to give you some context from the discussion."

**Morgan:** "Sure."

**Manager:** "During calibration, we reviewed all the Senior Developers across the organization. When we discussed your work - the API refactoring, the team leadership on the migration project, and the mentorship you've provided - the room agreed immediately that you're a clear High Performer."

"What stood out to people was the breadth of impact. You're not just delivering code - you're improving how the team works, raising the technical bar, and developing others. That's exactly what High Performance looks like."

**Morgan:** "That's good to hear."

**Manager:** "The calibration conversation also surfaced that you're on people's radar for leadership opportunities. [Senior Leader] specifically mentioned your name when we talked about succession planning for the team lead role."

"I want to make sure we're preparing you for that. Let's talk about what leadership development looks like for you - whether that's formal training, shadowing opportunities, or specific projects that build those skills."

**Morgan:** "I'd be interested in that."

**Manager:** "Great. My takeaway from calibration is that the organization sees your value clearly, and we need to make sure we're investing in your growth so you stay challenged and engaged. Let's set up time next week to talk about your development plan."

---

**Why this works:**

- Validates the employee's work explicitly
- Shares that the organization recognizes their value
- Provides specific examples of what stood out in calibration
- Connects current performance to future opportunities
- Shows proactive investment in the employee's growth
- Demonstrates that calibration adds value even when ratings don't change

### What to Avoid

These approaches damage trust and derail development conversations.

#### Blaming "The Process" or "Other Managers"

**Why it's destructive:**

When you blame calibration or other managers, you're signaling:
- You have no control or influence
- The process is unfair
- You didn't advocate effectively for your employee
- Organizational decisions are arbitrary

**What not to say:**

- "I fought for you, but they wouldn't listen."
- "The calibration process is flawed."
- "Other managers rated too high, so you got pulled down."
- "HR makes us do this, I don't agree with it."

**What to say instead:**

- "The calibration discussion helped us see how your work compares to organizational standards. Here's what we learned."
- "When we compared your achievements to peers at your level, here's what we observed."

#### Apologizing for Calibration

**Why it's destructive:**

When you apologize for calibration, you undermine the entire process and signal it's not legitimate.

**What not to say:**

- "I'm sorry, but calibration changed your rating."
- "I know this isn't fair, but the calibration committee..."
- "Unfortunately, we have to do calibration, and it affected you."

**What to say instead:**

- "Calibration helps us ensure consistent standards across the organization. Here's how it applied to your rating."
- "The calibration process surfaced some specific areas for development. Let's talk about what that means."

#### Making Promises You Can't Keep

**Why it's destructive:**

When you promise things you can't deliver, you create false hope and set yourself up for broken trust later.

**What not to say:**

- "Don't worry, I'll make sure you get High Performance next time."
- "This won't affect your compensation, I'll fight for you."
- "I'll get this rating reversed."
- "Just do X and you'll definitely be a High Performer."

**What to say instead:**

- "Here's what High Performance looks like at your level: [specifics]. If you demonstrate those achievements, that's the path to that rating."
- "I can't make promises about specific outcomes, but I can commit to giving you the opportunities and support to develop in these areas."
- "Rating is one input into compensation. I'll advocate for you based on your contributions."

## Development Planning by Box Position

Different grid positions require different development approaches. Here's what to do based on where employees land after calibration.

### High Potentials (Upper-Right Quadrant)

**Who they are:** High Performance + High Potential (positions 8, 9, 10)

These are your future leaders and your retention risks. They need investment, challenge, and visibility.

#### Next Steps: Stretch Assignments and Visibility

**Within 30 days:**

Schedule a development conversation focused on growth, not just current role performance.

**Stretch assignments to consider:**

- Lead a cross-functional initiative that affects multiple teams
- Represent the team in executive-level strategic discussions
- Mentor multiple junior employees
- Drive a high-visibility project with organizational impact
- Take on interim leadership during transitions

**Visibility projects:**

- Present to senior leadership or board
- Lead company-wide initiatives
- Speak at all-hands meetings or represent the company externally
- Join special projects or task forces

**The conversation:**

> "In calibration, you were clearly identified as a High Potential. The organization sees you as future leadership. Let's talk about what development looks like to prepare you for bigger roles. What interests you? What challenges you? What would make you feel like you're growing?"

#### Retention: Career Conversations and Investment

**Why this matters:**

High Potentials are the most likely to leave if they don't see a clear growth path. They need to know the organization is investing in their future.

**What to do:**

**Career pathing discussion:**
- "Where do you want to be in 2-3 years?"
- "What skills do you need to get there?"
- "What experiences would prepare you for that role?"

**Development investment:**
- Executive coaching
- Leadership training programs
- Conference attendance and speaking opportunities
- Shadowing senior leaders
- Rotational assignments to broaden experience

**Communication frequency:**
- Monthly development check-ins (not just project updates)
- Quarterly career conversations
- Annual planning for next 2-3 year trajectory

#### Timeline: 30-60 Days for Development Plan

**30-day milestone:** Initial career conversation and agreement on development goals

**60-day milestone:** Formal development plan with:
- Specific stretch assignments for next 6 months
- Skills to develop and how
- Visibility opportunities scheduled
- Check-in cadence established

**Ongoing:** Monthly progress reviews on development, not just project delivery

### Medium Performance + High Potential

**Who they are:** Medium Performance + High Potential (positions 5, 6, 7 - though 5 is center box)

These are your "diamonds in the rough" - employees with capability who aren't yet performing at high levels. They need skill development and more support.

#### Focus: Skill Development and Targeted Feedback

**Why they're in this position:**

- New to the role or level - still ramping up
- High capability but skill gaps in current role
- Strong potential but inconsistent execution
- Right talent, wrong role fit

**What they need:**

Specific, actionable skill development with close coaching.

**Skill development approach:**

- Identify the 2-3 specific skills holding them back from High Performance
- Create targeted training or development experiences
- Provide real-time feedback on those specific skills
- Give lower-stakes opportunities to practice

**The conversation:**

> "Your calibration rating shows high potential but medium performance. That tells me you have the capability to grow, but you're not quite there yet in your current role. Let's identify exactly what skills you need to develop and build a plan to get you there."

#### Manager Action: Increase Coaching Frequency

**What this looks like:**

**Weekly check-ins** focused on skill development, not just project status:
- "What went well this week in [target skill area]?"
- "What was challenging?"
- "What did you learn?"
- "What will you try differently next week?"

**Real-time feedback** when you see the target skill in action (or missing):
- "I noticed in that meeting you [specific behavior]. That's exactly the [skill] we're developing. Well done."
- "I saw you struggle with [specific situation]. Let's debrief what happened and what you could do differently next time."

**Scaffolded challenges:**
- Start with lower-stakes situations to practice skills
- Gradually increase complexity and stakes
- Provide support and feedback throughout

#### Timeline: 90-Day Check-In Cycle

**30-day milestone:** Identify the 2-3 specific skills to develop and create initial plan

**60-day milestone:** Mid-point check-in on progress:
- Are they demonstrating the target skills more consistently?
- What's working in the development approach?
- What needs to adjust?

**90-day milestone:** Assess progress and decide:
- Ready for High Performance? (Skills developed, performance improving)
- Still developing? (Making progress, continue the plan)
- Wrong role fit? (Not developing despite support - might need different role)

**The key:** Don't just wait and hope they improve. Active coaching and specific skill development makes the difference.

### Low Performance

**Who they are:** Low Performance ratings (positions 1, 2, 3, 4)

These employees aren't meeting expectations. They need honest feedback, clear improvement plans, and accountability.

#### When PIP Is Appropriate

**Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) is appropriate when:**

- Performance is significantly below expectations (not just slightly under)
- The issues have been communicated previously with no improvement
- You've provided support and resources, but performance hasn't changed
- The gap is in execution, skills, or behaviors that should exist at this level

**PIP is NOT appropriate when:**

- This is the first time you're communicating performance issues
- The employee hasn't had clear expectations or support
- The role is a poor fit, but the employee could succeed elsewhere
- You're using it as "documented path to termination" rather than genuine improvement opportunity

#### When Coaching Is Enough

**Coaching (without PIP) is appropriate when:**

- Performance issues are recent or situational
- The employee has shown improvement when given feedback
- Skill gaps are addressable with training and support
- The employee is new to the role and still ramping
- You haven't yet provided clear expectations and specific feedback

**What intensive coaching looks like:**

**Weekly 1:1s** focused entirely on performance improvement:
- Clear, specific expectations for the week
- Review of previous week's performance
- Real-time problem-solving on challenges
- Documented feedback (written notes after each conversation)

**Clear metrics for success:**
- "By end of month 1, I need to see [specific improvement]"
- "By end of month 2, I expect [higher bar]"
- "By end of month 3, you should be meeting expectations in [specific areas]"

**Documented support:**
- Training provided
- Resources given
- Obstacles removed
- Feedback delivered

#### How to Frame Development Without Demoralizing

**The balance:**

You need to be honest that performance isn't meeting expectations without destroying the employee's confidence or motivation.

**What to say:**

> "Your calibration rating is Low Performance. I know that's hard to hear. What it means is that your current performance isn't meeting the expectations for your role. I want to be completely clear about what needs to change and how I'm going to support you in making that change."

**What NOT to say:**

- "You're failing."
- "Everyone in calibration agreed you're the weakest performer."
- "I'm not sure you're capable of this role."
- "This is your last chance."

**Frame it as solvable:**

> "Here are the specific gaps: [list]. Here's what success looks like: [describe]. Here's how I'm going to support you: [plan]. And here's the timeline: [expectations]. I believe you can close these gaps, and I'm invested in helping you do it."

**Acknowledge the difficulty:**

> "I know this is difficult feedback. But I'd rather be honest with you now so we can work together to improve than let it continue without addressing it. You deserve to know where you stand and what you need to do."

#### Timeline: Immediate Action Required

**Within 1 week:**

Have the performance conversation. Don't wait. Low performers need to know immediately so they can start improving or make decisions about their future.

**Within 2 weeks:**

Create formal improvement plan (PIP or intensive coaching plan) with:
- Specific performance gaps documented
- Clear expectations for improvement
- Timeline for checkpoints
- Support and resources being provided
- Consequences if performance doesn't improve

**Weekly check-ins:**

Every week, review progress against the plan. Document what you see.

**30-60-90 day checkpoints:**

Formal reviews of progress:
- Meeting expectations? (Continue with normal management)
- Improving but not there yet? (Continue plan, adjust if needed)
- Not improving? (Make hard decision about role fit)

**The key:** Don't let Low Performance linger unaddressed. Immediate, clear, honest feedback with specific support gives employees the best chance to improve.

### Consistent High Performers (Stars)

**Who they are:** High Performance + High Potential (positions 8, 9, 10) who have been in that quadrant for multiple cycles

Your Stars are your retention risks and your organizational assets. Don't take them for granted.

#### Retention Conversations: What Keeps Them Engaged?

**The trap:** Assuming Stars are happy because they're performing well.

**The reality:** High performers have options. If they're not challenged, growing, and recognized, they'll find those things elsewhere.

**What to ask:**

> "You've been a High Performer for [X cycles]. I want to make sure we're keeping you challenged and engaged. What's energizing you right now? What's frustrating you? What would make this role even better?"

**Listen for signals:**

- "I'm doing the same things I did last year" = Need new challenges
- "I wish I could work on [X]" = Unfulfilled interests
- "I'm curious about [other role/team]" = Potential flight risk
- "I feel like I'm not growing" = Development need

#### Growth: Promotion Path and Scope Expansion

**Stars need to see a future, not just current rewards.**

**Promotion path conversation:**

> "Based on your performance, you're on track for [next level]. Here's what that typically looks like timeline-wise: [realistic expectations]. Here's what you need to demonstrate to get there: [specific criteria]. Let's build a plan to position you for that promotion."

**If promotion isn't available soon:**

> "Promotion timing is [realistic constraint]. In the meantime, let's talk about scope expansion - taking on bigger projects, more strategic work, broader impact. How can we grow your role even if the title doesn't change yet?"

**Scope expansion options:**

- Expand from team to multi-team impact
- Move from execution to strategy
- Add people leadership or mentorship responsibilities
- Take on organizational initiatives beyond your team
- Represent the company externally

#### Risk: Don't Take Them for Granted

**The biggest retention mistake:** Assuming Stars are fine because they're not complaining.

**What actually happens:**

- Month 1-6: Star performs well, gets positive feedback, feels valued
- Month 7-12: Star keeps performing, feedback becomes routine, growth plateaus
- Month 13-18: Star feels stagnant, starts wondering what else is out there
- Month 19-24: Recruiter reaches out, Star listens, opportunity sounds interesting
- Month 25: Star gives notice

**Prevention:**

**Monthly check-ins** that aren't just project updates:
- "What's challenging you right now?"
- "What do you want to learn?"
- "What would make this role more exciting?"

**Quarterly career conversations:**
- "Where do you want to be in a year?"
- "What growth do you need?"
- "What am I missing about what matters to you?"

**Annual retention reviews:**
- Proactively discuss compensation, role, growth, and satisfaction
- Don't wait for them to ask or threaten to leave
- Invest before you have to

**The key:** High performers need three things to stay: challenge, growth, and recognition. If they're not getting all three, they're at risk.

---

## Retention Conversations

Calibration reveals who you can't afford to lose. Now you need to make sure they stay.

### Proactive Outreach to Stars and Flight Risks

**Who needs retention conversations:**

**Stars (High Performance + High Potential):** Your future leaders and organizational assets

**Flight risks:** Employees showing Intelligence flags like:
- Applied for other roles
- Not applying for internal opportunities
- Performance declining
- Engagement dropping

**High performers who might be overlooked:** People who are delivering but might not feel recognized or see a path forward

**The approach:**

Don't wait for them to give notice. Proactive retention conversations signal that you see their value and are invested in their future.

### Understanding What Matters to Them (Not Assumptions)

**The trap:** Assuming you know what people want.

**Common wrong assumptions:**

- "They just want more money" (Maybe, but often it's challenge, recognition, or growth)
- "They're happy because they're performing well" (Performance ≠ Satisfaction)
- "They'll tell me if something's wrong" (High performers often don't - they just leave)

**The solution:**

Ask directly what matters to them.

**Questions to ask:**

> "What's keeping you engaged right now?"
>
> "What would make this role even better for you?"
>
> "If you think about staying here for the next 2-3 years, what would need to be true?"

> "What matters most to you right now - learning, impact, compensation, flexibility, something else?"
>
> "What would make you consider opportunities elsewhere?"

**Listen without defensiveness.**

If they say "I want to work on different technology" or "I wish I had more autonomy," don't immediately explain why they can't have that. Listen and explore what's possible.

### What to Offer (Growth, Recognition, Flexibility)

**What Stars typically want:**

**1. Challenge and Growth**
- Bigger scope
- More complex problems
- New skills or domains
- Leadership opportunities

**2. Recognition**
- Explicit acknowledgment of their impact
- Visibility to senior leadership
- Public credit for their work
- Compensation that reflects their value

**3. Autonomy**
- More decision-making authority
- Freedom to shape their work
- Ownership of outcomes
- Less micromanagement

**4. Impact**
- Work that matters
- Influence on strategy
- Ability to shape the organization
- Meaningful outcomes

**5. Flexibility**
- Work-life balance
- Remote work options
- Schedule flexibility
- Trust-based environment

**What you can often provide:**

Even if you can't control compensation or promotions, you usually CAN provide:
- Stretch assignments and growth opportunities
- Public recognition and visibility
- More autonomy in how they work
- Input into team strategy and direction
- Flexibility in work arrangements

### What to Avoid (Panic Retention Raises, Desperate Promises)

**Panic retention behaviors that backfire:**

**❌ Panic retention raises:**

When someone gives notice, suddenly offering a huge raise signals:
- You could have paid them more all along but chose not to
- You only value them when they threaten to leave
- Other employees should threaten to leave to get raises

**Better:** Proactive compensation reviews before they give notice

**❌ Desperate promises you can't keep:**

"I'll get you promoted next month!" (when you can't control that)

"You can work on whatever you want!" (when that's not realistic)

"Everything will change!" (when systemic issues exist)

**Better:** Honest conversation about what's possible and what's not

**❌ Blaming them for not speaking up sooner:**

"Why didn't you tell me you were unhappy?"

**Better:** "I should have asked sooner. Tell me what's going on."

**❌ Making it personal:**

"After everything I've done for you, you're leaving?"

**Better:** "I'm disappointed to lose you, but I understand. What would have made you stay?"

### Using Intelligence Flags for Early Warning

**Intelligence tab in 9Boxer shows patterns like:**

- Applied internally (looking for other opportunities)
- Not applying (disengaged from growth)
- Performance changes (trending down)
- Tenure patterns (tenure relative to peers)

**How to use this:**

**Proactive check-in when you see flags:**

> "I noticed you applied for the [X role]. Tell me about that - what interests you? What are you looking for that you're not getting in your current role?"

Don't be defensive. Be curious. This is valuable data about what they want.

> "I noticed you haven't applied for any of the internal opportunities recently. Is everything okay? What would make you excited to apply?"

**The goal:**

Catch flight risk early when you can still do something about it, not after they've already decided to leave.

## Coaching Managers on Their Patterns

Calibration reveals which managers understand organizational standards and which ones are outliers. Use this data to develop your managers.

### How to Coach Managers Who Consistently Rate High/Low

**The manager who rates everyone high:**

**What it signals:**

- Unclear understanding of organizational performance standards
- Conflict avoidance (doesn't want to have hard conversations)
- Prioritizing employee happiness over accuracy
- May have genuinely strong team (rare, but possible)

**How to coach them:**

> "[Manager], I've noticed your ratings tend to be higher than peers across the organization. Let's talk about what might be happening."
>
> "There are a few possibilities: either your team is genuinely stronger than most teams (which is possible), or we're using different definitions of High Performance. Let's explore which it is."
>
> "When you think about High Performance at the [level] level, what does that mean to you? Here's what it means organizationally: [specific criteria]. How do those compare?"

**Provide calibration:**

Show them examples of what High Performance looks like elsewhere in the organization. Help them see the bar.

**The manager who rates everyone low:**

**What it signals:**

- Unrealistic expectations for the level
- Harsh or critical management style
- Disconnection from organizational standards
- May be holding people to senior-level expectations at junior levels

**How to coach them:**

> "[Manager], I've noticed your ratings tend to be lower than peers. That might mean you have a legitimately struggling team, or it might mean your expectations are different from organizational norms. Let's figure out which it is."
>
> "Tell me about what you expect from a Medium Performer at the [level] level. Here's what the organization typically sees at that level: [examples]. How does that compare to your expectations?"

**Provide recalibration:**

Help them see that their bar might be set for the next level up, not the actual level their employees are at.

### Using Calibration Patterns as Development Data

**Track over time:**

- Does this manager's ratings get closer to organizational norms after calibration?
- Do they show learning from one cycle to the next?
- Are they able to articulate evidence for their ratings more clearly over time?

**Calibration is manager development:**

A manager who consistently over-rates is learning to:
- Set clearer expectations
- Differentiate performance levels
- Have harder conversations
- Understand organizational standards

A manager who consistently under-rates is learning to:
- Recognize strong performance
- Appreciate different working styles
- Adjust expectations to the appropriate level
- Build confidence in their team

**Use calibration performance as part of manager evaluations:**

"How well does this manager understand and apply organizational performance standards?"

This is a core management skill.

### Helping Managers Develop Judgment Over Time

**First calibration:** Manager is learning what organizational standards are

**Second calibration:** Manager is trying to apply those standards but may still be off

**Third+ calibration:** Manager should be converging toward organizational norms

**If they're not converging:**

This is a development issue. They need more support, examples, or coaching on performance evaluation.

**How to develop their judgment:**

**1. Pre-calibration practice:**

Before calibration, review their ratings with them:
- "Walk me through your High Performers. What makes them High?"
- "Here's how that compares to organizational standards..."

**2. Comparative examples:**

Show them examples of High Performance from other teams:
- "Here's what [High Performer in another team] delivered. How does that compare to your High Performers?"

**3. Post-calibration debrief:**

After calibration, discuss what they learned:
- "What surprised you in calibration?"
- "How are you thinking about High Performance differently now?"
- "What will you do differently next cycle?"

**4. Ongoing development:**

Throughout the year, not just at calibration time:
- "How would you rate that work if we were calibrating today?"
- "Is that High Performance at their level, or Medium?"

### Positioning Feedback as Growth, Not Criticism

**Don't say:**

"Your ratings were wrong."

"You don't understand organizational standards."

"You rate too high/low compared to everyone else."

**Do say:**

"Calibration showed some differences between your ratings and organizational norms. That's valuable data for your development as a manager. Let's talk about what we're seeing and how to close that gap."

"Understanding performance standards is a skill that develops over time. Here's what we can do to help you get better at this..."

"The goal isn't to criticize your judgment - it's to help you calibrate your understanding of what High/Medium/Low looks like at each level. Let's work on that together."

**The frame:**

Manager development, not manager failure.

Every manager needs to learn organizational standards. Calibration is where that learning happens.

**Final Thought**

Calibration decisions sitting in a spreadsheet accomplish nothing. The conversations that follow - manager to employee, manager to high potential, manager to struggling performer - are what make calibration valuable.

Within 30 days of calibration, every employee whose rating changed should know where they stand and what's next. That's how you turn organizational process into organizational development.
