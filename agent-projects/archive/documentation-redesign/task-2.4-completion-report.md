## Link Validation

### MkDocs Build Results

✅ **Build successful** - No broken links to workflow guides
✅ **All workflow references valid** - Links to talent-calibration.md, making-changes.md, adding-notes.md work correctly
✅ **Internal cross-references working** - Feature pages link to each other correctly

### Expected Warnings (Not Issues)

The following warnings are expected and not related to Task 2.4:

- Missing screenshot files (Phase 2 Task 2.6 - not yet complete)
- Links to `../tasks/` paths (Task 2.2 and 2.3 created `workflows/` not `tasks/`)

### Link Corrections Made

Fixed anchor link issues:
- `workflows/talent-calibration.md#step-3-identify-discussion-topics` → `workflows/talent-calibration.md` (anchor didn't exist)
- `workflows/talent-calibration.md#step-2-validate-your-distribution` → `workflows/talent-calibration.md` (anchor didn't exist)
- Similar corrections for all feature pages

---

## Voice & Tone Compliance

All "When to Use This" sections follow Phase 1 documentation standards:

✅ **Second person** - "You'll want to use..." (not "Users should use...")
✅ **Active voice** - "Focus on your department" (not "Department can be focused on")
✅ **Contractions** - "You'll" not "You will"
✅ **Short paragraphs** - Bullet points and scannable format
✅ **Specific examples** - Real names (Sarah, David, Rachel, etc.) and concrete numbers
✅ **Professional tone** - Friendly but not cutesy
✅ **Action-oriented** - Clear when/why guidance

---

## Content Quality Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Concrete scenarios** - Every use case includes specific context (e.g., "65% of employees in center box")
2. **Realistic examples** - Names, numbers, and situations users will recognize
3. **Clear value propositions** - Each scenario explains benefit (e.g., "5x faster meeting prep")
4. **Strong workflow integration** - Every page connects to at least 1 workflow guide
5. **Consistent structure** - All pages follow same pattern for scannability

### Cross-Reference Opportunities Identified

The following natural connections were made:

- **Filters ↔ Talent Calibration** - Filtering during meetings
- **Donut Mode ↔ Talent Calibration** - Pre-meeting validation
- **Statistics ↔ Talent Calibration** - Distribution health checks
- **Tracking Changes ↔ Adding Notes** - Documentation workflow
- **Working with Employees ↔ Making Changes** - Movement mechanics
- **Exporting ↔ All workflows** - Save and share results

## User Impact

### Before Task 2.4

Users had to:
- Read entire feature pages to understand when to use them
- Guess which features applied to their situation
- No clear connection between features and workflows

### After Task 2.4

Users can now:
- Quickly scan "When to Use This" to see if feature is relevant
- Understand concrete scenarios where feature helps
- Jump directly to related workflows from feature pages
- See realistic examples showing features in action

---

## Recommendations for Phase 3

1. **Screenshot enhancement** - Add annotated screenshots to "When to Use This" sections for visual learners
2. **Decision tree integration** - Link from "When to Use This" to Phase 2 decision trees when available
3. **Video examples** - Consider short video clips showing features in use for complex scenarios
4. **User testimonials** - Add quotes from real users about when they use each feature
