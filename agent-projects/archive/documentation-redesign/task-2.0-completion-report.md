## Fixes Applied

### ✅ Fix 1: Export Terminology Update (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**File:** `internal-docs/getting-started.md`
**Lines affected:** 5, 168, 228-238, 312

**Problem:** Documentation referred to "Export button" but the actual UI uses a File menu with "Apply X Changes to Excel" option.

**Changes made:**

1. **Lines 228-238 - Export section (main fix):**
   - **BEFORE:**
     ```markdown
     1. **Click the Export button** in the top-right corner

        ![Export button with badge showing "3" changes ready to export](images/screenshots/export-button-with-badge.png)

     2. **Your file downloads automatically**
     ```
   - **AFTER:**
     ```markdown
     1. **Open the File menu** (the button that shows your filename)

     2. **Click "Apply X Changes to Excel"** in the dropdown
        (The number X shows how many changes you've made)

        ![File menu dropdown with 'Apply 3 Changes to Excel' option highlighted](images/screenshots/file-menu-apply-changes.png)

     3. **Your file downloads automatically**
     ```

2. **Line 168 - Badge reference:**
   - **BEFORE:** `**The badge on the Export button** updates to show how many changes you've made.`
   - **AFTER:** `**The File menu badge** updates to show how many changes you've made.`

3. **Line 312 - Quick Reference Card:**
   - **BEFORE:** `| Export my work | Click Export button (downloads Excel file) |`
   - **AFTER:** `| Export my work | File menu → Apply X Changes to Excel (downloads file) |`

4. **Line 72 - Troubleshooting link (bonus fix found):**
   - **BEFORE:** `[Learn how to troubleshoot upload errors](troubleshooting.md#upload-issues)`
   - **AFTER:** `[Learn how to troubleshoot upload errors](troubleshooting.md#file-upload-issues)`

**Screenshot specification updated:**
- OLD: `export-button-with-badge.png`
- NEW: `file-menu-apply-changes.png`
- Alt text: "File menu dropdown with 'Apply 3 Changes to Excel' option highlighted"

**Verification:**
- [x] Text updated in all locations
- [x] Screenshot specification updated
- [x] No other references to "Export button" in file
- [x] Terminology matches actual UI workflow

---

### ✅ Fix 2: Step 2 Skip Link Anchor

**File:** `internal-docs/getting-started.md`
**Line:** 5

**Problem:** Anchor link didn't match the actual heading ID generated by MkDocs.

**Changes made:**
- **BEFORE:** `Skip to [Step 2: Review Your Distribution](#step-2-review-your-distribution)`
- **AFTER:** `Skip to [Step 2: Review Your Distribution](#step-2-review-your-distribution-3-minutes)`

**Verification:**
- [x] Link updated
- [x] MkDocs build successful
- [x] Anchor matches actual heading on line 76: `## Step 2: Review Your Distribution (3 minutes)`

---

### ✅ Fix 3: Common Tasks Link

**File:** `internal-docs/quickstart.md`
**Line:** 115

**Problem:** Link pointed to non-existent `#common-tasks` anchor in index.md.

**Changes made:**
- **BEFORE:** `[Jump to specific tasks](index.md#common-tasks)`
- **AFTER:** `[Jump to specific tasks](index.md#need-specific-help)`

**Verification:**
- [x] Link updated
- [x] Anchor exists in index.md (line 39: `## Need Specific Help?`)
- [x] MkDocs build successful
- [x] Link jumps to correct section

---

### ✅ Fix 4: Troubleshooting Anchor Links

**File:** `internal-docs/getting-started.md`
**Lines:** 319-322

**Problem:** Troubleshooting links used incorrect anchor names that didn't match actual headings in troubleshooting.md.

**Changes made:**

1. **Upload link:**
   - **BEFORE:** `[Troubleshooting upload errors](troubleshooting.md#upload-issues)`
   - **AFTER:** `[Troubleshooting upload errors](troubleshooting.md#file-upload-issues)`
   - Matches heading on line 68: `## File Upload Issues`

2. **Employees not appearing link:**
   - **BEFORE:** `[Check if filters are active](troubleshooting.md#employees-dont-appear)`
   - **AFTER:** `[Check if filters are active](troubleshooting.md#employees-dont-appear-after-upload)`
   - Matches heading on line 173: `### Employees Don't Appear After Upload`

3. **Drag and drop link:**
   - **BEFORE:** `[Drag and drop troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#drag-and-drop-issues)`
   - **AFTER:** `[Drag and drop troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#drag-and-drop-issues)`
   - Already correct! Matches heading on line 234: `## Drag and Drop Issues`

4. **Export link:**
   - **BEFORE:** `[Export troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#export-issues)`
   - **AFTER:** `[Export troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#export-issues)`
   - Already correct! Matches heading on line 263: `## Export Issues`

**Verification:**
- [x] Opened troubleshooting.md to verify actual heading names
- [x] Updated 2 incorrect links (upload and employees not appearing)
- [x] Verified 2 links were already correct (drag/drop and export)
- [x] MkDocs build successful with no anchor warnings

## Ready for User Testing

### Pre-Testing Checklist

- [x] All 4 required fixes completed
- [x] MkDocs builds without errors
- [x] All anchor links tested and working
- [x] Voice consistency maintained
- [x] No new issues introduced
- [x] Export section matches actual UI workflow
- [x] Technical accuracy verified

### Known Limitations

**Screenshot placeholders:** All image references point to placeholder paths in `images/screenshots/`. These will be addressed in Phase 2 (Screenshot Generation).

**Expected behavior:**
- MkDocs will show warnings about missing image files
- This is normal and expected at this stage
- Screenshots will be generated in Phase 2

---

## Next Steps

With Phase 1 fixes complete, the documentation is ready for:

1. ✅ **User Testing (Task 2.1)** - Recruit 2-3 participants and conduct testing sessions
2. **Phase 2: Screenshot Generation** - Create all required screenshots
3. **Phase 3: Final Review & Polish** - Incorporate user feedback and finalize

---

## Recommendations

### For User Testing

1. **Focus areas for testers:**
   - Clarity of export instructions (Fix 1 was highest priority)
   - Effectiveness of internal navigation links
   - Ability to find troubleshooting help when needed

2. **Questions to ask:**
   - "Can you find how to save your changes?"
   - "If you had a problem uploading, how would you find help?"
   - "Can you skip to Step 2 from the intro?"

3. **Success metrics:**
   - Users can locate export instructions within 10 seconds
   - Users successfully navigate between sections using links
   - Users understand "File menu → Apply Changes" terminology

### For Phase 2

**Screenshot priorities (based on Fix 1):**
1. `file-menu-apply-changes.png` - NEW, critical for export workflow
2. ~~`export-button-with-badge.png`~~ - DEPRECATED, no longer needed
3. All other placeholder screenshots per original specification
