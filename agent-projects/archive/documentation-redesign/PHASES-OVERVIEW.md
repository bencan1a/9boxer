## Agent Execution Model

### Parallel Agent Orchestration

All phases use parallel AI agent execution to maximize efficiency:

**Phase 1:** 7 agents in 4 groups (~35 agent-hours in ~2 wall-hours)
**Phase 2:** 7 agents in 4 groups (~30 agent-hours in ~2 wall-hours)
**Phase 3:** 8 agents in 5 groups (~42 agent-hours in ~6-8 wall-hours)

**Total:** 22 agents executing ~107 agent-hours in ~10-12 wall-hours

### Agent Instructions & Standards

Every agent receives:
1. **Voice & Tone Guidelines**
   - Second person ("you", "your")
   - Contractions, active voice
   - Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences)
   - Encouraging, friendly tone

2. **Content Structure Requirements**
   - Time estimates
   - Learning objectives
   - Success indicators
   - What's next navigation

3. **Validation Requirements**
   - Test against actual running application
   - Verify all data-testid attributes
   - Check workflows end-to-end
   - Use Playwright for automation

4. **Screenshot Specifications**
   - 2400px width (2x for retina)
   - Red highlight boxes (#FF0000)
   - Blue numbered callouts (#1976D2)
   - Descriptive alt text

### Quality Assurance

Each phase ends with comprehensive review:
- Voice/tone consistency check
- Content cohesion validation
- User journey flow testing
- Technical accuracy verification
- Accessibility compliance
- Cross-reference validation

---

## Documentation Standards

### Core Principles

1. **User-Centric Organization** - Organize by user goals, not features
2. **Progressive Disclosure** - Basics first, advanced features later
3. **Active Voice & Second Person** - "You click Upload" not "Upload should be clicked"
4. **Visual Guidance** - Screenshots with annotations for every workflow
5. **Success Indicators** - Tell users what success looks like
6. **Contextual Help** - Explain why, not just how
7. **Task-Based Learning** - Teach through realistic scenarios
8. **Accessibility First** - WCAG AA compliance minimum
9. **Consistent Voice** - Friendly, encouraging, never condescending
10. **Continuous Validation** - Test against actual app, not assumptions

**Full Standards:** [documentation-standards-and-assessment.md](documentation-standards-and-assessment.md) (150+ pages)
