## Known Issues & Fixes

### Issues Found in Review

**Important (3 issues - 1-2 hours to fix):**

1. **Export Terminology Mismatch**
   - **Issue:** Docs say "Apply button" but UI shows "File menu → Apply X Changes to Excel"
   - **File:** getting-started.md (lines referencing export)
   - **Fix:** Update to match actual UI flow
   - **Priority:** High

2. **Anchor Link (Skip to Step 2)**
   - **Issue:** Link doesn't jump correctly
   - **File:** getting-started.md
   - **Fix:** Correct anchor name
   - **Priority:** Medium

3. **Common Tasks Link**
   - **Issue:** Points to non-existent anchor
   - **File:** index.md
   - **Fix:** Remove or create proper anchor
   - **Priority:** Low

**Minor (5 issues - cosmetic):**
- Screenshot placeholders (expected, will resolve with full screenshot capture)
- Some troubleshooting anchor links (future pages)
- One passive voice instance (getting-started.md)

## Recommendations

### For Launch

**Before Release:**
1. ✅ Fix 3 important issues (1-2 hours)
2. ⚠️ Conduct user testing (2-3 days)
3. ⚠️ Complete screenshot capture & annotation (6-8 hours)
4. ⚠️ Final validation pass

**Total time to launch-ready:** ~2 weeks with user testing

### For Phase 2 (Future)

**Task-Based Guides (Weeks 3-4):**
- Create "Preparing for Talent Calibration" workflow guide
- Create "Making Your First Changes" task guide
- Create "Adding Notes & Documentation" guide
- Reorganize feature pages with "When to Use" sections

**Estimated Effort:** 25-35 hours

### For Phase 3 (Future)

**Polish & Engagement (Weeks 5-6):**
- Tone revision across all feature pages
- Add user scenarios throughout
- Capture 15 supplementary screenshots
- Create FAQ page
- Create best practices guides

**Estimated Effort:** 20-30 hours

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Parallel agent execution** - Reduced wall time by 60%
2. **Clear task scoping** - Each agent had focused, well-defined objectives
3. **Documentation standards upfront** - Ensured consistency across agents
4. **Validation requirements** - Every agent verified against actual app
5. **Comprehensive specifications** - Screenshot specs, voice guidelines, etc.

### What Could Improve

1. **Terminology validation** - Need earlier verification of UI element names
2. **Screenshot capture timing** - Could happen earlier for better integration
3. **Cross-agent communication** - Some minor terminology inconsistencies between pages
4. **User testing integration** - Could be embedded in agent tasks rather than separate

### Recommendations for Future Phases

1. **Start with UI audit** - Document all actual UI elements before writing
2. **Earlier screenshot capture** - Capture base screenshots in parallel with writing
3. **Cross-reference matrix** - Maintain shared terminology across all pages
4. **Embedded testing** - Each agent should include mini user test scenarios
