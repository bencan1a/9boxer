## Step 1: Prepare Your File (30 seconds)

Your Excel file needs **4 columns** with these exact names:

<div style="background: #1e1e1e; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; font-family: monospace; margin: 20px 0;">
<table style="color: #fff;">
<tr style="background: #2d2d2d;">
<th>Employee ID</th>
<th>Worker</th>
<th>Performance</th>
<th>Potential</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1001</td>
<td>Sarah Chen</td>
<td>High</td>
<td>High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1002</td>
<td>Marcus Johnson</td>
<td>Medium</td>
<td>High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1003</td>
<td>Emma Rodriguez</td>
<td>High</td>
<td>Medium</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

**Column requirements:**
- Names are **case-sensitive** (capitalize first letters)
